## R package to simulate metapopulations for portfolio optimization

The metafolio R package accompanies the paper: 

Anderson, S.C., J.W. Moore, M.M. McClure, N.K. Dulvy, A.B. Cooper. Portfolio conservation of metapopulations under climate change. Ecological Applications. In press.

See `inst/examples/README.R` for the analysis from the paper.

See `inst/ms/ms.md` for the paper itself.

If you have the necessary package development prerequisites installed, you can install the package by running:

```S

devtools::install_github("seananderson/metafolio")
```

The package will be submitted to CRAN shortly.
