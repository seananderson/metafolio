# R package to simulate metapopulations for portfolio optimization

Reusable functions are in the `R` folder. Current work in development, figures, and writing are in the `inst/examples` folder.

This is ongoing work for a PhD thesis chapter (by Sean Anderson). Until this work is published, please contact Sean (sean "at" seananderson.ca) before using the code in any of your own work that will be published.

The package can be installed and loaded in R by running:

    # install.packages("devtools")
    devtools::install_github("metafolio", username="seananderson")

Since there a couple C++ functions, you will need a C/C++ compiler to build the package from source.
