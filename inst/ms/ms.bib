@Article{	  ando2012,
  abstract	= {Climate change is likely to alter the spatial
		  distributions of species and habitat types but the nature
		  of such change is uncertain. Thus, climate change makes it
		  difficult to implement standard conservation planning
		  paradigms. Previous work has suggested some approaches to
		  cope with such uncertainty but has not harnessed all of the
		  benefits of risk diversification. We adapt Modern Portfolio
		  Theory (MPT) to optimal spatial targeting of conservation
		  activity, using wetland habitat conservation in the Prairie
		  Pothole Region (PPR) as an example. This approach finds the
		  allocations of conservation activity among subregions of
		  the planning area that maximize the expected conservation
		  returns for a given level of uncertainty or minimize
		  uncertainty for a given expected level of returns. We find
		  that using MPT instead of simple diversification in the PPR
		  can achieve a value of the conservation objective per
		  dollar spent that is 15{\%} higher for the same level of
		  risk. MPT-based portfolios can also have 21{\%} less
		  uncertainty over benefits or 6{\%} greater expected
		  benefits than the current portfolio of PPR conservation.
		  Total benefits from conservation investment are higher if
		  returns are defined in terms of benefit--cost ratios rather
		  than benefits alone. MPT-guided diversification can work to
		  reduce the climate-change--induced uncertainty of future
		  ecosystem-service benefits from many land policy and
		  investment initiatives, especially when outcomes are
		  negatively correlated between subregions of a planning area.},

		  designing a decision support system for planned adaptation
		  to climate change that uses the principles of modern
		  portfolio theory to minimise risk and maximise return of
		  adaptive actions in an environment of deep uncertainty over
		  future climate scenarios. Here we show how modern portfolio
		  theory can use the results of a climate change impact model
		  to select an optimal set of seed sources to be used in
		  regenerating forests of white spruce in an environment of
		  multiple, equally plausible future climates. This study
		  shows that components of solutions are not selected to
		  perform equally well across all plausible futures; but
		  rather, that components are selected to specialise in
		  particular climate scenarios. The innovation of this
		  research rests in demonstrating that the powerful and
		  widely used principles of quantifying and planning for risk
		  and return in the uncertain environment of asset markets
		  can be applied successfully to serve the objectives of
		  planned adaptation to climate change.},

  abstract	= {This paper introduces the theory and application of
		  discrete choice models to resource selection studies.
		  Discrete choice models calculate the probability of an
		  individual selecting a resource as a function of the
		  attributes of that resource and all other available
		  resources. The data for these attributes may be continuous
		  or categorical. When availability is the same for all
		  individuals and only two resources are available, the
		  multinomial logit discrete choice model reduces to the
		  logistic model. Discrete choice models and advances in GIS
		  technology give the researcher flexibility in defining
		  resource availability separately for each individual over
		  time and space. The output of the discrete choice approach
		  also provides managers with a tool to explore the effects
		  of potential management actions and provides researchers
		  with new hypotheses deserving of further investigation, To
		  illustrate the application of discrete choice models to
		  resource selection studies, we present a case study of
		  summer diurnal bed site selection by elk (Cervus elaphus)
		  in Cuter State Park, South Dakota, United States. The
		  results demonstrate the importance of factors relating to
		  thermal regulation, hiding cover, and potentially forage,
		  in elk bed site selection in this region.},
