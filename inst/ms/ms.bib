@Article{	  Ando2012,
  abstract	= {Climate change is likely to alter the spatial
		  distributions of species and habitat types but the nature
		  of such change is uncertain. Thus, climate change makes it
		  difficult to implement standard conservation planning
		  paradigms. Previous work has suggested some approaches to
		  cope with such uncertainty but has not harnessed all of the
		  benefits of risk diversification. We adapt Modern Portfolio
		  Theory (MPT) to optimal spatial targeting of conservation
		  activity, using wetland habitat conservation in the Prairie
		  Pothole Region (PPR) as an example. This approach finds the
		  allocations of conservation activity among subregions of
		  the planning area that maximize the expected conservation
		  returns for a given level of uncertainty or minimize
		  uncertainty for a given expected level of returns. We find
		  that using MPT instead of simple diversification in the PPR
		  can achieve a value of the conservation objective per
		  dollar spent that is 15{\%} higher for the same level of
		  risk. MPT-based portfolios can also have 21{\%} less
		  uncertainty over benefits or 6{\%} greater expected
		  benefits than the current portfolio of PPR conservation.
		  Total benefits from conservation investment are higher if
		  returns are defined in terms of benefit--cost ratios rather
		  than benefits alone. MPT-guided diversification can work to
		  reduce the climate-change--induced uncertainty of future
		  ecosystem-service benefits from many land policy and
		  investment initiatives, especially when outcomes are
		  negatively correlated between subregions of a planning area.},

  abstract	= {Genes, species and ecosystems are often considered to be
		  assets. The need to ensure a sufficient diversity of this
		  asset is being increasingly recognised today. Asset
		  managers in banks and insurance companies face a similar
		  challenge. They are asked to manage the assets of their
		  investors by constructing efficient portfolios. They
		  deliberately make use of a phenomenon observed in the
		  formation of portfolios: returns are additive, while risks
		  diversify. This phenomenon and its implications are at the
		  heart of portfolio theory. Portfolio theory, like few other
		  economic theories, has dramatically transformed the
		  practical work of banks and insurance companies. Before
		  portfolio theory was developed about 50 years ago, asset
		  managers were confronted with a situation similar to the
		  situation the research on biodiversity faces today. While
		  the need for diversification was generally accepted, a
		  concept that linked risk and return on a portfolio level
		  and showed the value of diversification was missing.
		  Portfolio theory has closed this gap. This article first
		  explains the fundamentals of portfolio theory and transfers
		  it to biodiversity. A large part of this article is then
		  dedicated to some of the implications portfolio theory has
		  for the valuation and management of biodiversity. The last
		  section introduces three development openings for further
		  research.},

@Article{	  Schindler2010,
  abstract	= {One of the most pervasive themes in ecology is that
		  biological diver- sity stabilizes ecosystem processes and
		  the services they provide to society1--4, a concept that
		  has become a common argument for bio- diversity
		  conservation5. Species-rich communities are thought to
		  produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because
		  of the complementary or independent dynamics among species
		  that per- form similar ecosystem functions6. Such variance
		  dampening within communities is referred to as a portfolio
		  effect7 and is analogous to the effects of asset diversity
		  on the stability of financial portfolios8. In ecology,
		  these arguments have focused on the effects of species
		  diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered
		  the impor- tance of biologically relevant diversity within
		  individual species9. Current rates of population
		  extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude
		  higher than species extinction rates10, so there is a
		  pressing need to clarify how population and life history
		  diversity affect the performance of individual species in
		  providing impor- tant ecosystem services. Here we use five
		  decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in
		  Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of
		  portfolio effects that derive from population and life
		  history diversity in an important and heavily exploited
		  species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns
		  is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted
		  of a single homogenous population rather than the several
		  hundred discrete populations it currently consists of.
		  Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population,
		  such increased variability would lead to ten times more
		  frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also
		  evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and
		  extend predator access to salmon resources. Our results
		  demon- strate the critical importance of maintaining
		  population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and
		  securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them.
		  The reliability of ecosystem services will erode faster
		  than indicated by species loss alone.},

@Article{	  Cooper1999a,
  abstract	= {This paper introduces the theory and application of
		  discrete choice models to resource selection studies.
		  Discrete choice models calculate the probability of an
		  individual selecting a resource as a function of the
		  attributes of that resource and all other available
		  resources. The data for these attributes may be continuous
		  or categorical. When availability is the same for all
		  individuals and only two resources are available, the
		  multinomial logit discrete choice model reduces to the
		  logistic model. Discrete choice models and advances in GIS
		  technology give the researcher flexibility in defining
		  resource availability separately for each individual over
		  time and space. The output of the discrete choice approach
		  also provides managers with a tool to explore the effects
		  of potential management actions and provides researchers
		  with new hypotheses deserving of further investigation, To
		  illustrate the application of discrete choice models to
		  resource selection studies, we present a case study of
		  summer diurnal bed site selection by elk (Cervus elaphus)
		  in Cuter State Park, South Dakota, United States. The
		  results demonstrate the importance of factors relating to
		  thermal regulation, hiding cover, and potentially forage,
		  in elk bed site selection in this region.},
