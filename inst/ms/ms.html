<li><p>Managing risk is fundamental to the conservation of an endangered species. When an endangered species exists as a metapopulation, we can manage risk at two levels: at the population level or at the metapopulation level. Whereas risk is typically managed at the population level, a portfolio approach to managing risk might consider how conservation affects the “weight” of each population in a metapopulation “portfolio”.</p></li>
<li><p>Here, we ask how a portfolio approach to managing risk can inform the spatial conservation of metapopulations in a changing world. To answer this, we develop a salmon metapopulation simulation in which population-specific productivity is driven by spatially-distributed environmental tolerance and patterns of short- and long-term environmental change. We then implement different spatial conservation “rules of thumb” that control the population-specific carrying capacities and evaluate the salmon portfolios along risk and return axes, similarly to how financial portfolios are assessed.</p></li>
<li><p>Our results show, first, that maintaining populations with a variety of environmental tolerances gives the best chance at an efficient ecological portfolio — minimizing metapopulation variance while maximizing metapopulation growth rate. This finding emphasizes the risk of allowing large spatial blocks of habitat destruction, say through the development of dams. Second, we show that focusing on well-performing stocks now at the detriment of others is at best equivalent to a risky but efficient portfolio and is more likely a risky and inefficient portfolio — it neither minimizes metapopulation variance nor maximizes growth rate compared to other strategies. Third, we show that maintaining more populations reduces metapopulation risk for the same spatial conservation strategy. Given a lack of knowledge of how populations respond to the environment, the most risk-averse approach is to conserve as many populations as possible.</p></li>
<li>Our findings highlight three key points: (1) the conservation priority of maintaining biocomplexity and therefore environmental response diversity,</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the research priority of identifying differences in environmental tolerance given predicted environmental changes, and (3) the utility of considering risk for groups of fish stocks — especially given environmental, biological, and implementation uncertainty — through the lens of portfolio theory.</li>

<p>Managing risk fundamental to conservation of metapopulations</p>
<p>Portfolios provide another way of managing risk - explain mean-variance optimization and how this translates to ecology [@Figge2004][@Hoekstra2012] [@Ando2011,@Ando2012][@Markowitz1952,@Markowitz1959]</p>
<p>We use salmon as an example, describe the components of the example, provide references on metapopulation existence [@Schindler2010]</p>
<p>Research questions, and briefly our approach - Monte Carlo simulation modelling, as simple a model as possible while retaining important realistic aspects of salmon metapopulations</p>

<p>general overview</p>
<p>See Figure  for an illustration of the simulation structure.</p>
<h2 id="salmon-metapopulation-dynamics">Salmon metapopulation dynamics</h2>
<p>We are using a Ricker curve,</p>

<p>where <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> represents a generation time, <span class="math"><em>i</em></span> represents a population, <span class="math"><em>R</em></span> is the number of returns, <span class="math"><em>S</em></span> is the number of spawners, <span class="math"><em>a</em></span> is the productivity parameter (which can vary with the environmental signal), and <span class="math"><em>b</em></span> is the density-dependent term (which is used as the asset weights in the portfolios). The term <span class="math"><em>w</em><sub><em>t</em><em>i</em></sub></span> represents first-order autocorrelated error (AR1). Formally, <span class="math"><em>w</em><sub><em>t</em><em>i</em></sub> = <em>w</em><sub><em>t</em><em>i</em> − 1</sub><em>ρ</em><sub><em>w</em></sub> + <em>v</em><sub><em>t</em><em>i</em></sub></span>, where <span class="math"><em>v</em><sub><em>t</em><em>i</em></sub></span> represents independent and normally distributed error with mean 0 and standard deviation of <span class="math"><em>σ</em><sub><em>v</em></sub></span>. The parameter <span class="math"><em>ρ</em><sub><em>w</em></sub></span> represents the correlation between residuals from subsequent generations.</p>
<p>We implemented straying as in @Cooper1999. We generate a matrix that represents the fraction of straying between any two populations. We have set up the metapopulation (thus far) in a very simple scenario: the populations are arranged in a line and those that are nearer to each other are more likely to stray between each other [insert caveats]. Two parameters control the straying: the fraction of fish <span class="math"><em>f</em><sub><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>r</em><em>a</em><em>y</em></sub></span> that stray from their natal stream in any given generation and the rate at which this straying between streams decays with distance <span class="math"><em>m</em></span>. We calculated the number of salmon straying from stream <span class="math"><em>j</em></span> to stream <span class="math"><em>i</em></span> as,</p>

<p>where <span class="math"><em>R</em><sub><em>t</em><em>j</em></sub></span> is the number of returning salmon at generation <span class="math"><em>t</em></span> whose natal stream was stream <span class="math"><em>j</em></span>. The subscript <span class="math"><em>k</em></span> represents a stream ID and <span class="math"><em>n</em></span> the number of populations. The denominator is a normalizing constant to ensure the desired fraction of fish stray. See Figure  for an example straying matrix.</p>
