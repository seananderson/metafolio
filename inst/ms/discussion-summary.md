Current structure
=================

1.  opening paragraph summarizing our findings

Salmon
------

2.  our results emphasize need to maintain response diversity for salmon (DONE
    rework opening sentence of this paragraph to emphasize this as the topic)

3.  existing salmon management goals relate to this

-   TODO add paragraph emphasizing that theory is not meeting practice

4.  how we complement other salmon models

Broader
-------

5.  emphasize thinking at portfolio level (with risk and return axes) for
    conservation decisions

-   TODO build in spatial planning here? maybe also bring in spatial planning
    that can promote asynchrony/response diversity

6.  extensions of our model (TODO replace most salmon examples) (TODO
    emphasize the advantage we bring with multi-population modelling) (TODO
    add some predictions) (TODO add utility for spatial planning and Ando et
    al.)

7.  broad research priorities our results suggest (TODO replace most salmon
    examples)

8.  concluding paragraph (TODO rework this to come back to opening paragraph,
    see notes)

TODO
====

1.  In general, decrease focus on salmon (in general, little need to cut from
    salmon section, but substitute non-salmon examples in non-salmon section
    and expand 2nd section that moves beyond salmon).

2.  Add paragraph on ecological conditions and management actions that
    increase diversity of response to environmental conditions.

3.  Build in spatial planning for climate change and Ando et al. 2012.

4.  Emphasize disconnect between theory of salmon management and practice
    (with examples from US).

5.  Consider moving some VSP rules of thumb to introduction.

6.  Include a bit about what including multi-population modelling (as opposed
    to, say, Shiraz) means.

7.  Build on concrete extensions and applications of our work.

    a.  Predict what it would tell us about PDO
    b.  Use to inform protected area design (Ando...)

8.  Add discussion of how low abundance (and straying) could erode response
    diversity.

9.  Build new final paragraph, which answers main questions we start in the
    introduction:
    a.  What do we add to the problem of "Untangling the mechanisms that
        underpin the stability of ecological systems"?
    b.  What role does response diversity have to play, and how have we shown
        that a focus on metapopulations is important?
    c.  What does this work suggest about what work is critical given
        uncertainty and risk due to environmental change and ecological
        reactions to that change
