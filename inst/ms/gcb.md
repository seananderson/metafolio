# Formatting

Max of 8000 words for primary research articles



Microsoft Word or Corel WordPerfect, Rich Text Format or Post Script (NOT a pdf).

margins of at least 2.5 cm.

Lines must be double-spaced and text must be in Times New Roman font, 12 point.

each section beginning on a separate page

1. Title page
      i. Title: this should be concise and informative
      ii. Running head: a shortened title with no more than 45 characters, including spaces
      iii. List of authors
      iv. Institute or laboratory of origin: Where authors have different addresses, use numbered superscripts to refer to each address provided
      v. Corresponding author: include their telephone, fax and email details
      vi. Keywords: 6 – 10 key words or short phrases to enable retrieval and indexing by searching techniques. Authors are encouraged to include scientific names, common names, and pseudonyms that are not mentioned in the title.
      vii. Type of Paper

The abstract should be less than 300 words for Primary Research Articles and Reviews,

6. Discussion
This should highlight the significance of the results and place them in the context of other work. It should not introduce new material, be over-speculative, reiterate the results, or exceed 20% of the total length.

(et al. is in italics)

10. Supporting Information legends
Short legend for each supporting information file.

11. Tables

12. Figure legends

Therefore, the first 100 characters of any legend should inform the reader of key aspects of the figure. If you wish to publish figures in color online and grayscale in print, figure legends should be appropriate for both color and grayscale versions; do not refer to colors in the figure.

Graphics/figures of accepted manuscripts must be 300dpi or above and in pdf, tiff or eps format.

fit within a single (80 mm) or double column width (169 mm). Figure panels should be labeled with lower case, bold letters in parentheses (e.g. (a), (b)) and referred to in the text in the form Fig. 1a, Fig. 1a,b.

Online color is free; authors will be charged for color in print (currently £150 for the first figure, £50 thereafter).

Scale/tick marks on graphs should be inside the axes. Only 5-7 ticks should be labeled per axis

The preferred symbols are open and closed circles, squares, triangles. Symbols should be 3 mm across. Data lines should be 0.5 mm thick.

 14. Supporting information

# Other instructions

Name and e-mail address of 3-5 suggested reviewers. While these selections may be taken into account, the final selection is subject to the Editor's discretion. These suggestions must be without a conflict of interest with the authors including former or current coauthors (within the past 4 years), students, mentors and members of the same academic institution. Authors may also indicate up to three non-preferred referees.

- use "Materials and methods"


# References
The reference list should be in alphabetical order and include the full title with the name of the journal given in full. The number of references is limited for Commentaries and Letters (max 10). When there are eight or more authors, only the first three should be listed, followed by "et al.". For example:

After refs:
10. Supporting Information legends

11. Tables
Each table should be on a separate page, numbered, and accompanied by an explanatory caption. Each table must be referred to in the text. Tables must be in editable Word or Excel format (NOT embedded in picture format). Data must not be presented in both tabular and graphical form. The number of tables and figures for Commentaries and Letters is limited to two.


12. Figure legends
Figure legends should be listed one after the other, as part of the text document, separate from the figure files. Do not include legends below the figures. Enough detail should be given so that the figure can be understood without reference to the text. In the full-text online edition of the journal, figure legends may be truncated in abbreviated links to the full screen version. Therefore, the first 100 characters of any legend should inform the reader of key aspects of the figure. If you wish to publish figures in color online and grayscale in print, figure legends should be appropriate for both color and grayscale versions; do not refer to colors in the figure.

13. Figures
All figures should be uploaded as separate files, with the figure number incorporated in the file name. Graphics/figures of accepted manuscripts must be 300dpi or above and in pdf, tiff or eps format. Figures should be cropped or scaled to the size intended for publication. Most figures should fit within a single (80 mm) or double column width (169 mm). Figure panels should be labeled with lower case, bold letters in parentheses (e.g. (a), (b)) and referred to in the text in the form Fig. 1a, Fig. 1a,b.

Figures may be published (1) in color both in the online journal and in the printed journal, (2) in color online and grayscale in print, or (3) in grayscale both in the online journal and in the printed journal. Online color is free; authors will be charged for color in print (currently £150 for the first figure, £50 thereafter). The Color Work Agreement Form should be completed in all instances where authors require color, whether in print or online. The form is not required for color figures that are part of online Supporting Information. If you wish to publish figures in color online and grayscale in print, you are responsible for ensuring that color figures are understandable when converted to grayscale and that text references and captions and figure legends are appropriate for both online and print versions.

- Scale/tick marks on graphs should be inside the axes.
