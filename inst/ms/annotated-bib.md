@allendorf1997
--------------
-	Propose a ranking scheme for prioritizing Pacific salmon stocks based on 
  both

- PVA and biological consequences of extinction	


@baguette2004
-------------
- Basically, we need to loosen up on "classical metapopulation theory" for it 
  to be useful. Classical definition is rare and maybe not always applicable 
  to conservation or empirical work

@battin2007
-----------
- Climate change will have big impact on freshwater salmon habitat; 
  restoration and protection of habitat therefore critical. Great uncertainty 
  inherent and management approaches must deal with this (as ours does). 
  Maintaining genetic and life-history diversity is one approach.

@cariveau2013
-------------
- detected response diversity but didn't lead to stability of ecosystem 
  services for pollinators

@colwell1998
-----------
- The first paper to use the term "biocomplexity". (Plenary transcript from 
  AIBS.)

@cooper1999
-----------
- Dangerous to ignore metapopulation structure of salmon metapopulations

@crozier2008
------------
- Any "further decline in fitness significantly threatens" the persistence of 
  Snake River spring/summer Chinook	

- Thermal response diversity possible via differences in behaviour to reduce 
  heat exposure (they cite Berman and Quinn 1991, Togersen et al. 1991, Goniea 
  et al. 2006)

- Salmon life-history diversity is 2 part: (1) phenotypic plasticity to 
  environment and (2) location adaptation throughout lifecycle.	"Life-history 
  diversity in salmon reflects a combination of phenotypic plasticity in 
  response to variable environmental conditions (Hutchings 2004) and local 
  adaptation throughout the life cycle, across the complete suite of life 
  history, morphological, physiological, and behavioral traits (Ricker 1972; 
  Groot and Margolis 1991; Taylor 1991; Quinn 2005)."    

> "Local adaptation is facilitated by strong natal homing that limits gene
> flow between populations in different selective environments."	

- Earlier migration over last century for Chinook and sockeye in Columbia over 
  last century.

- Fitness effects of warmer water - various - behaviour inhibition, disease, 
  reduced growth and development, increased energetic costs (they cite 
  McCullough 1999 and Materna 2001, which are reviews).

- Great review of expected evolutionary responses of salmon to climate change. 	
  "we emphasize the interacting and cumulative effects of climate change 
  across the life cycle"

- In N Pacific Ocean warming impacts on salmon habitat: (1) rising temperature 
  of upper ocean - increased stratification, (2) wind pattern changes, which 
  affect upwelling of nutrients, (3) ocean acidification, which will impact 
  plankton and those trophically linked.

- Main climate influence in freshwater: (1) changes in snow melt timing, (2) 
  greater hydrologic extremes (droughts and floods more extreme), (3) higher 
  temperatures of streams and watershed in general.

- Thermal diversity possible through disease resistance diversity with 
  increased temperature.

@denboer1968
------------
- Life history diversity reduces extinction risk and reduces risk of low 
  productivity with strong environment 

@donato2002
-----------
- much of salmon rearing habitat in (Snake River?) already exceeds optimal 
  temperatures for salmonids

@eliason2011
------------
- Thermal tolerance or limits vary within sockeye salmon populations (by 
  stock) according to historical environmental conditions	cardiorespiratory 
  physiology varies at the population level among Fraser River sockeye salmon 
  and relates to historical env. conditions encountered while migrating	

@elmqvist2003
-------------
- Defines response diversity; states that it's important to resilience; 
  provides "adaptive capacity"

@fahrig2003
-----------
- A (massive) review of the effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity. 
  Habitat loss -> "large, consistently negative effects on biodiversity". 
  Fragmentation -> weaker effects, could be positive or negative. So, measure 
  these seprately.

- highlight cited (~2100)

> "Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process
> involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat."

@gilpin1991
-----------
- The book that set off metapopulation biology

@haight2008
-----------
- Ideal design of reserves depends on "emigration, dispersal mortality, and 
  probabilities of movement between reserves"


@hilborn2003
------------
- Maintenance of biocomplexity (a diversity of life-history strategies) an 
  important component of long-term sustainability

- specifically, they show that not all sockeye in Bristol Bay respond 
  similarly to the environment. And, fishing causes less variability than 
  natural processes.	
  
> We believe that long-term sustainability is derived in large part from
> complementary patterns of productivity in different stock components; It
> would seem prudent to try to prevent loss of such stock components,
> including those that appear, at present, to be unproductive.
> biocomplexity

@hindar2004
-----------
- Need to consider genetic effects of harvesting both at local and 
  metapopulation level	The genetic consequences of harvesting need to be 
  assessed both at the levels of local populations and the metapopulation.

@hodgson2002
------------
- Climate change impact on salmon; temperatures already approach lethal limits 
  in XX.
  
@isaak2003
----------
- (1) Salmon metapopulations become more synchronized at low abundance

- (2) dispersal unlikely to affect population dynamics unless abundance really 
  low where it can synchronize
  
@kindvall1996
-------------
- (1) Habitat heterogeneity can create different responses to the same 
  conditions (for bush cricket metapopulations)

- (2) extinction risk higher in homogeneous habitats

- keyword: environmental filter

@levins1969
-----------
- First paper to coin term metapopulation

@levins1970
-----------
- Second paper to coin term metapopulation

@liebhold2004
-------------
- Spatial synchrony can occur because of: (1) dispersal between populations 
  (2) Moran effect, (3) trophic interactions with other pops that are 
  synchronous

- shared environment and dispersal more likely for closer populations


@mace1991 (highly cited)
------------------------
- Define criteria for assessing extinction threat â€” useful if doing local 
  extinction recording (keyword: extinction risk)
  
@materna2001
------------

- review of effects of warmer water on salmon

@mcclure2003
------------
- again, Snake River Chinook threatened by any further decline in fitness
