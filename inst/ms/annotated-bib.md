Notes
=====

@allendorf1997
--------------

-   Propose a ranking scheme for prioritizing Pacific salmon stocks
    based on both

-   PVA and biological consequences of extinction

@baguette2004
-------------

-   Basically, we need to loosen up on "classical metapopulation theory"
    for it to be useful. Classical definition is rare and maybe not
    always applicable to conservation or empirical work

@battin2007
-----------

-   Climate change will have big impact on freshwater salmon habitat;
    restoration and protection of habitat therefore critical. Great
    uncertainty inherent and management approaches must deal with this
    (as ours does). Maintaining genetic and life-history diversity is
    one approach.

@cariveau2013
-------------

-   detected response diversity but didn't lead to stability of
    ecosystem services for pollinators

@colwell1998
------------

-   The first paper to use the term "biocomplexity". (Plenary transcript
    from AIBS.)

@cooper1999
-----------

-   Dangerous to ignore metapopulation structure of salmon
    metapopulations

@crozier2008
------------

-   Any "further decline in fitness significantly threatens" the
    persistence of Snake River spring/summer Chinook

-   Thermal response diversity possible via differences in behaviour to
    reduce heat exposure (they cite Berman and Quinn 1991, Togersen et
    al. 1991, Goniea et al. 2006)

-   Salmon life-history diversity is 2 part: (1) phenotypic plasticity
    to environment and (2) location adaptation throughout lifecycle.
    "Life-history diversity in salmon reflects a combination of
    phenotypic plasticity in response to variable environmental
    conditions (Hutchings 2004) and local adaptation throughout the life
    cycle, across the complete suite of life history, morphological,
    physiological, and behavioural traits (Ricker 1972; Groot and
    Margolis 1991; Taylor 1991; Quinn 2005)."

> "Local adaptation is facilitated by strong natal homing that limits
> gene flow between populations in different selective environments."

-   Earlier migration over last century for Chinook and sockeye in
    Columbia over last century.

-   Fitness effects of warmer water - various - behaviour inhibition,
    disease, reduced growth and development, increased energetic costs
    (they cite McCullough 1999 and Materna 2001, which are reviews).

-   Great review of expected evolutionary responses of salmon to climate
    change: "we emphasize the interacting and cumulative effects of
    climate change across the life cycle"

-   In N Pacific Ocean warming impacts on salmon habitat: (1) rising
    temperature of upper ocean - increased stratification, (2) wind
    pattern changes, which affect upwelling of nutrients, (3) ocean
    acidification, which will impact plankton and those trophically
    linked.

-   Main climate influence in freshwater: (1) changes in snow melt
    timing, (2) greater hydrologic extremes (droughts and floods more
    extreme), (3) higher temperatures of streams and watershed in
    general.

-   Thermal diversity possible through disease resistance diversity with
    increased temperature.

@denboer1968
------------

-   Life history diversity reduces extinction risk and reduces risk of
    low productivity with strong environment

@donato2002
-----------

-   much of salmon rearing habitat in (Snake River?) already exceeds
    optimal temperatures for salmonids

@eliason2011
------------

-   Thermal tolerance or limits vary within sockeye salmon populations
    (by stock) according to historical environmental conditions
    cardiorespiratory physiology varies at the population level among
    Fraser River sockeye salmon and relates to historical environmental
    conditions encountered while migrating

@elmqvist2003
-------------

-   Defines response diversity; states that it's important to
    resilience; provides "adaptive capacity"

@fahrig2003 (highly cited \~2100)
---------------------------------

-   A (massive) review of the effects of habitat fragmentation on
    biodiversity. Habitat loss -\> "large, consistently negative effects
    on biodiversity". Fragmentation -\> weaker effects, could be
    positive or negative. So, measure these separately.

> "Habitat fragmentation is usually defined as a landscape-scale process
> involving both habitat loss and the breaking apart of habitat."

@gilpin1991
-----------

-   The book that set off metapopulation biology

@haight2008
-----------

-   Ideal design of reserves depends on "emigration, dispersal
    mortality, and probabilities of movement between reserves"

@hilborn2003
------------

-   Maintenance of biocomplexity (a diversity of life-history
    strategies) an important component of long-term sustainability

-   specifically, they show that not all sockeye in Bristol Bay respond
    similarly to the environment. And, fishing causes less variability
    than natural processes.

> We believe that long-term sustainability is derived in large part from
> complementary patterns of productivity in different stock components;
> It would seem prudent to try to prevent loss of such stock components,
> including those that appear, at present, to be unproductive.
> biocomplexity

@hindar2004
-----------

-   Need to consider genetic effects of harvesting both at local and
    metapopulation level The genetic consequences of harvesting need to
    be assessed both at the levels of local populations and the
    metapopulation.

@hodgson2002
------------

-   Climate change impact on salmon; temperatures already approach
    lethal limits in XX.

@isaak2003
----------

-   Salmon metapopulations become more synchronized at low abundance;
    risk of simultaneous extirpations increases

-   Important to not only focus on maintaining large subpopulations but
    also on desynchronizing subpopulations

-   Dispersal unlikely to strongly affect population dynamics unless
    abundance really low where it can synchronize

Papers to get:

> "Studies on a wide range of animal taxa have addressed the topic of
> spatial synchrony (see **reviews by Bjornstad et al. (1999) and Koenig
> (1999)**). Almost invariably, these studies document a negative
> relationship between correlation in a population parameter — typically
> abundance — and the geo- graphic distance separating populations. At
> short distances, dispersal of individuals between populations is
> believed to be a primary synchronizing factor (Sutcliffe et al. 1997;
> Ranta et al. 1997), but correlated environments also synchronize
> population dynamics and may act over greater distances (Heino et al.
> 1997). Local factors, such as density dependence, heterogeneities in
> habitats, or small-scale stochastic events, can override or decrease
> the importance of synchronizing agents and result in population
> asynchronies (Haydon and Steen 1997; Kendall et al. 2000)."

@kindvall1996
-------------

-   Habitat heterogeneity can create different responses to the same
    conditions (for bush cricket metapopulations)

-   extinction risk higher in homogeneous habitats

-   keyword: environmental filter

@levins1969
-----------

-   First paper to coin term metapopulation

@levins1970
-----------

-   Second paper to coin term metapopulation

@liebhold2004
-------------

-   Spatial synchrony can occur because of:

(1) dispersal between populations
(2) Moran effect,
(3) trophic interactions with other pops that are synchronous

-   shared environment and dispersal more likely for closer populations

@mace1991 (highly cited)
------------------------

-   Define criteria for assessing extinction threat — useful if doing
    local extinction recording (keyword: extinction risk)

@mcclure2003
------------

-   again, Snake River Chinook threatened by any further decline in
    fitness

@mceacheran2000
---------------

-   Defines VSP and ESU

@michener2001
-------------

-   Carefully define biocomplexity; discuss role and future as NSF
    program

-   Define biocomplexity as : "...properties emerging from the interplay
    of behavioural, biological, chemical, physical, and social
    interactions that affect, sustain, or are modified by living
    organisms, including humans."

@mobrand1997
------------

-   We need to include more than productivity and capacity when
    considering salmon performance --- a third dimension of life-history
    diversity ("through time, space, and life stage") is critical.
    (Beyond the "bottleneck" approach). This includes connectivity.

@moritz1994 (highly cited; 1870)
--------------------------------

-   **Defines ESU** (main first paper to carefully define)

-   "significant" refers to historical isolation and therefore has a
    "distinct potential".

-   ESUs mostly relevant for longterm conservation (defining priorities
    and "setting strategy").

-   Defines Management Units (MU s) too. MU s more useful for short-term
    management... reflect current population structure and short-term
    management issues.

-   "The overriding purpose of defining ESUs to ensure that evolutionary
    heritage is recognized and protected and that the evolutionary
    potential inherent across the set of ESUs is maintained." "MU s are
    the logical unit for population monitoring and demographic study."

@nehlsen1991
------------

-   A lot of salmon stocks at risk of extinction in Pacific NW

From Allendorf:

> "214 native stocks of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), steelhead
> (O. mykiss), and coastal cutthroat trout (O. clarki clarki) are at
> risk of extinction in California, Oregon, Idaho, and Washing- ton
> (Nehlsen et al. 1991). This list includes 101 stocks at high risk, 58
> stocks at moderate risk, and 54 stocks of special concern, along with
> one stock listed as threatened under the U. S. Endangered Species Act
> of 1973 (Nehlsen et al. 1991)."

@peterman1998
-------------

-   Region-level subpopulations react in diverse ways to the environment
    (shown through survival rates); a combination of freshwater (and
    less so) marine processes

@quinn1993
----------

-   Straying occurs (review). Only consequences are unknown. Straying is
    quite different from stream to stream, hard to come up with general
    values. Effect of straying not just amount but also mating and
    survival success. We can't predict straying well yet.

@quinn2005
----------

-   Main pacific salmon reference. One point: Because anadromous salmon
    pops spend time together in ocean, even if far apart in freshwater
    experience same environment in ocean, and so correlation may decay
    less than you'd think with distance

@rahel2013
----------

-   Intentionally fragmenting aquatic systems also has benefits …
    intentional fragmentation may be beneficial when it prevents the
    spread of nonnative species or exotic diseases, eliminates
    hybridization between hatchery and wild stocks, or stops individuals
    from becoming entrapped in sink environment

@ricker1972
-----------

-   Defines a salmon stock; rivers may have multiple stocks. There can
    be substantial genetic differences between stocks. Differences
    between stocks usually have both genetic and environmental
    components.

> Salmon stock definition: "... the fish spawning in a particular lake
> or stream (or portion of it) at a particular season, which fish to a
> substantial degree do not interbreed with any group spawning in a
> different place, or in the same place at a different season"

> most of the studied differences between local stocks can and usually
> do have both a genetic and an environmental basis"

@schindler2008
--------------

-   Landscape can act as "heterogeneous filter" of climate for salmon
    populations, need management and policies that are "robust to
    unknowns" and "responsive to change" It is useful to think of salmon
    landscapes as heterogeneous filters of climate

@schtickzelle2007
-----------------

-   Anadromous salmon likely fulfil the 3 requirements to be defined as
    a metapopulation: discrete populations, some asynchrony; some
    dispersal. Useful concept, but, the concept is rarely used or
    tested. ...only 0.25% of the papers on conservation and/or
    management of salmonids list the keyword "metapopulation"

-   Main implications of salmon metapopulation dynamics:

1.  Metapopulation dynamics can influence persistence or collapse
    (ecological time scale) and

2.  Evolution and adaptation (evolutionary time scale)

-   Dispersal likely just enough to "ensure recolonization of suitable
    habitat"

-   Salmon tend to stray near their natal stream, although not
    necessarily those closest

@waples1991 (highly cited)
--------------------------

-   Defines ESUs (for purposes of salmon for ESA listings) 2 criteria:
    "substantially reproductively isolated from other conspecific
    population units" and "represent[s] an important component in the
    evolutionary legacy of the species"; "isolation does not have to be
    absolute"

@beacham1989
------------

-   Beacham and Murray 1989 (from Crozier et al. 2008 (1) - review):
    example of thermal tolerance diversity: lower survival of eggs and
    embryos, and reduced yolk "conversion efficiency" for coastal
    Chinook salmon than juveniles

@beacham1991
------------

-   (from Crozier et al. 2008 (1) review) greater tolerance to warmth
    for southern BC juvenile Chinook than northern BC pops
