# Opening paragraph - reiterate main message
  * population diversity leads to stability in realistic metapopulation
    under climate change
  * also numbers...
  * we explicitly show how maintaining populations with a variety of
    environmental tolerances translates into lower-risk metapopulations
    across a variety of possible environmental scenarios   
  * focusing on well-performing stocks now at the detriment of others,
    is at best equivalent to a risky but efficient portfolio, at worst
    a poorly performing risky portfolio

# Describe interpretation of key risk-return elements; turn into take home rules of thumb
  * All recommendations for maintaining response diversity from Moore et
    al. 2010 (summarize those briefly?)
  * If closer populations are more correlated with each other, and you
    must prioritize, then focus on a selection that aren't spatially
    contiguous (as long as straying is maintained) to maximize diversity
    of response to the environment
  * Precautionary management: we assume precautionary abundance should
    we also be precautionary about response diversity?

# Link simulation and results to real issues for PNW salmon
  * Examples of response diversity, specifics that match up with
    modelling framework
    * maybe Doug's paper - genetic diversity is best predictor of
      response diversity
  * Range contraction
    * temp. tolerance - spatial contraction of pops - one would predict
      increased variance and risk - losing response diversity 
  * Extinction isn't random
    * really bad or really good, but not random
    * e.g. salmon in upper watershed tend to be impacted more by dams

# Highlight how this complemets similar prioritization work
  * shiraz - single population
  * Other...

# Climate change and response diversity
  * those that seem productive and/or stable now may not be in the
    future
  * by eliminating large spacial areas (e.g. damns) you're creating
    a higher risk ecological portfolio, if you get lucky you'll be OK,
    you might do much worse
  * Cheung et al. and Mantua papers
  * Stock-recruit Fredu paper cod and Benjamin Plonque CJFAS
  * Rogers and Schindler PNAS long-term fluctuations

# There are a number of extensions to our simulation that would be fruitful.
  * We're only looking at one dimension of response diversity - thermal
    tolerance. All sorts of other kinds - climate, flow, predators and
    prey, behaviour...
  * Metapopulations of other taxa, but also
    * Community ecology
    * Metacommunities
  * Work with environmental filter concept on own or in addition to
    response diversity
  * On longer timespan - evolution element
  * We sought general rules of thumb; could also be used to optimize
    decisions as part of decision analysis
  * Working with more finely tuned scenarios to test competing
    management hypotheses
  * Tailoring these kinds of simulations to real systems

# Our work suggests a number of broader applied research priorities.
  * Identifying response diversity and spatial correlation (e.g. thermal
    tolerance curves in the Science paper)
  * Identifying what drives recruitment in different scenarios - env.
    relationship, regimes?
  * Looking for real-life case studies as in situ experiments testing
    our conclusions

# What new do we learn for management and conservation?
  * Intuitive results, but we don't think about aggregate risk much, but
    should
  * salmon management conservation is highly fragmentary - dispersed
    among hatchery managers, who for example are trucking and releasing
    smolts all over the downstream catchment into sanf bay - no planning
    about whether that's a sensible strategy given climate
  * another dimension of conservation - or persistence
  * not just leave all dams in place... reinvigorate selection for
    response diversity;  double whammy of damns - hatcheries added,
    further removing response diversity
  * Scale of management; integrated management planning

# Link to existing guidelines and mandates in Canada and the US
  * VSP and ESUs
  * DFO Wild Salmon Policy
  * criteria for threat status
  * threat status in wild salmon policy - designate MUs sort of ESUs,
    and evaluate with different levels of management intervention

# Concluding paragraph
  * reiterate rules of thumb and priorities
  * reiterate utility of general portfolio simulation approach

# Extra
- Ignore? Unpack richness and diversity elements
    * Beta, diversity between streams
    * beta diversity (response diversity - differences between assets),
      prioritizing different dimensions of diversity - turnover
      * alpha and beta
      * beta diversity describing temporal turnover
    * Alpha, diversity within stream
