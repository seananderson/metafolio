Dear Prof. Hassell,

We would be grateful if you would consider our manuscript entitled "Portfolio conservation of metapopulations under climate change" for publication as a Research Article in *Proceedings B*.

How does biodiversity stabilize ecology? While much is known of the effect of global change on abundance and richness, little is known of the effects on the stability of ecological systems. Here, we show the stabilizing effect of environmental response diversity on salmon metapopulations under climate variability and change. Maintaining response diversity minimizes risk given short-term environmental noise and ensures persistence given long-term environmental change. Even when response diversity is unknown, doubling the number of subpopulations in the conservation portfolio is sufficient to halve metapopulation variability. Our work is novel and highly significant because we quantitatively show how conserving trait response diversity, such as thermal tolerance, may be critical to conserving metapopulations in the face of climate variability and change. Although the stabilizing effect of response diversity is a widely-held tenet of ecology, we provide one of the first measures of the importance of this effect.

This work is timely given the rapidly expanding interest in ecological portfolios, the increasing need for ecological prioritization that considers risk, and the still largely unquantified mechanisms driving temporal stability and productivity in metapopulations. The results will also be of broad interest to *Proceedings B* readers due to the broad applicability of our model --- although we use salmon and temperature as examples to ground our results --- our analyses are applicable to a wide variety of taxa and environmental drivers. We provide an R package to enable readers to extend our results to other taxa and drivers of local and global change.

This work is entirely original; none of it has been previously published and it is not under consideration elsewhere. All authors have approved this manuscript.
