%-   60 pages including everything

%> Ecological Applications is concerned broadly with the applications of
%> ecological science to environmental problems. It publishes papers that
%> develop scientific principles to support environmental
%> decision-making, as well as papers that discuss the application of
%> ecological concepts to environmental issues, policy, and management.
%> Papers may report on experimental tests, actual applications,
%> scientific decision support techniques, economic analyses, social
%> implications of environmental issues, or other relevant topics.
%> Statistical or experimental methods papers that support research and
%> applications are welcome. Papers submitted to Ecological Applications
%> should be accessible to both scholars and practitioners.

\textit{Statement of authorship}: SCA, JWM, NKD, and ABC designed the analyses. SCA wrote the simulation and analyzed the results. SCA and XX \ldots wrote the manuscript. All authors participated in conception, discussion of the results, and manuscript preparation.
%Contributions by authors should be listed on the title page and will be printed at the end of the manuscript. This statement should be appropriate to the study described in the manuscript and should clarify who designed the study, who performed the research, who provided new methods or materials, and who wrote the manuscript. We encourage concise statements such as “JW performed phylogenetic analyses, MH collected data, performed modeling work and analyzed output data, and PK performed the meta-analysis. MH wrote the first draft of the manuscript, and all authors contributed substantially to revisions.”
