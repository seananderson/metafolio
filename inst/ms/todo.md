For introduction:

- keep it short: 3-4 sentences perhaps
- untangling the mechanisms that underpin stability
- response diversity in first paragraph; include @mori2013
- little work on response diversity compared to other elements of
  diversity-stability-functionality literature; and we don't have models for
  the mechanism
- big review papers - what is stability - multidimensionality of stability
  (Ecol Letters) to justify
- lots of work, but still confused about it
- bring in @ando2012 in intro and concluding paragraph
- Loreau and others worked a lot on communities - but not metapopulations
- need mechanisms

For conclusion:

- what do we add to our understanding of response diversity, stability, and
  variability?
- what do we learn about spatial prioritization in a changing world?
- given global change... take this ongoing effort to unpack stability and put
  it into management perspective
- bring in @ando2012 again

- we think of biodiversity as biomass, abundance, richness... 3rd dimension of
  variance, but we have little understanding of that... we show a pathway or
  mechanism... how it could play out, bring in Loreau

Concrete examples of how management has failed to conserve local adaptation:

- Devon Pearse paper - historic California steelhead, genetic samples from
  100 years and now - slim portfolio now - distribution of historical
  patterns...
- resilient salmon resilient fisheries 2009 - healey - ecology and society
  (maybe a good reviewer)
