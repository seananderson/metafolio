  Managing risk is fundamental to the conservation of an endangered
  species. When an endangered species exists as a metapopulation, we can
  manage risk at two levels: at the population level or at the
  metapopulation level. Whereas risk is typically managed at the
  population level, a portfolio approach to managing risk might consider
  how conservation affects the ``weight'' of each population in a
  metapopulation ``portfolio''.
\item
  Here, we ask how a portfolio approach to managing risk can inform the
  spatial conservation of metapopulations in a changing world. To answer
  this, we develop a salmon metapopulation simulation in which
  population-specific productivity is driven by spatially-distributed
  environmental tolerance and patterns of short- and long-term
  environmental change. We then implement different spatial conservation
  ``rules of thumb'' that control the population-specific carrying
  capacities and evaluate the salmon portfolios along risk and return
  axes, similarly to how financial portfolios are assessed.
\item
  Our results show, first, that maintaining populations with a variety
  of environmental tolerances gives the best chance at an efficient
  ecological portfolio --- minimizing metapopulation variance while
  maximizing metapopulation growth rate. This finding emphasizes the
  risk of allowing large spatial blocks of habitat destruction, say
  through the development of dams. Second, we show that focusing on
  well-performing stocks now at the detriment of others is at best
  equivalent to a risky but efficient portfolio and is more likely a
  risky and inefficient portfolio --- it neither minimizes
  metapopulation variance nor maximizes growth rate compared to other
  strategies. Third, we show that maintaining more populations reduces
  metapopulation risk for the same spatial conservation strategy. Given
  a lack of knowledge of how populations respond to the environment, the
  most risk-averse approach is to conserve as many populations as
  possible.
\item
  Our findings highlight three key points: (1) the conservation priority
  of maintaining biocomplexity and therefore environmental response
  diversity, (2) the research priority of identifying differences in
  environmental tolerance given predicted environmental changes, and (3)
  the utility of considering risk for groups of fish stocks ---
  especially given environmental, biological, and implementation
  uncertainty --- through the lens of portfolio theory.

Here, we ask how a portfolio approach to management can inform the
conservation of metapopulations in a changing world. We ask two primary
questions: (1) What does portfolio optimization tell us about different
spatial approaches to prioritizing metapopulation conservation assuming
that response diversity is spatially distributed? (2) In a scenario
where we don't know the population-level response diversity, what does
portfolio optimization tell us about the number of populations
conserved? To answer these questions, we develop a salmon metapopulation
simulation in which population-specific productivity is driven by
spatially-distributed environmental tolerance and patterns of short- and
long-term climatic change. We then implement different conservation
``rules of thumb'' that control the population-level carrying
capacities. We evaluate the salmon portfolios along risk and return
axes, similarly to how financial portfolios are assessed. Our findings
illustrate that: (1) conserving response diversity buffers
metapopulation risk given short-term climate forcing and rate of return
given long-term climate forcing, (2) conserving more subpopulations
buffers risk regardless of the climate trend, and (3) considering
metapopulations through the lens of portfolio theory provides a useful
additional dimension through which we can evaluate conservation
strategies.

\section{Methods}

We developed a salmon metapopulation simulation model that includes a
stock-recruit relationship, demographic stochasticity, straying between
populations, varying responses to the environment, escapement target
setting, and implementation uncertainty. Under two kinds of
environmental regimes we tested different conservation rules of thumb
and evaluated these plans in risk-return space similar to how financial
managers evaluate financial portfolios. See Figure \ref{f:sim-flow} for
an illustration of the overall simulation structure. See Table
\ref{t:pars} for a list of the input parameters to our simulation and
their default values. We provide a package \texttt{metafolio} for the
statistical software \texttt{R} \citep{r2013} as an appendix, to carry
out the simulations and analyses we describe in this paper.

\subsection{Defining the ecological portfolio}

In our ecological portfolios, we defined assets as stream-level
populations and the portfolios as salmon metapopulations (Table
\ref{t:port}). We use the terms \textit{stream} and \textit{populations}
interchangeably to represent the portfolio assets. We defined the
portfolio investors as the stakeholders in the fishery and
metapopulation performance. For example, we could consider fisheries
managers, conservation agencies, or First Nations groups as investors.
We defined asset value as the abundance of returning salmon in each
stream and value of the portfolio as the overall metapopulation
abundance. In this scenario, the equivalent to financial rate of return
is the generation-to-generation rate of change of metapopulation
abundance. We defined the financial asset investment weights as the
capacity of the stream populations --- specifically the unfinished
equilibrium stock size --- since maintaining or restoring habitat
requires money, time, and resources.

\subsection{Salmon metapopulation dynamics}

The salmon metapopulation dynamics in our simulation were governed by a
spawner-return relationship with stochastic demographic noise and by
straying between populations.

\subsubsection{Spawner-return relationship}

We defined the spawner-return relationship with a Ricker model
\citep{ricker1954},

\begin{equation}
R_{ti} = S_{ti}e^{a_{ti}(1-S_{ti}/b_i) + w_{ti}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $t$ represents a generation time, $i$ represents a
population, $R$ is the number of returns, $S$ is the number of spawners,
$a$ is the productivity parameter (which can vary with the environment),
and $b$ is the density-dependent term (which is used as the asset
weights in the portfolios). The term $w_{ti}$ represents first-order
autocorrelated error. Formally, $w_{ti} = w_{ti-1} \rho_w + v_{ti}$,
where $v_{ti}$ represents independent and normally distributed error
with mean 0 and standard deviation of $\sigma_v$. The parameter $\rho_w$
represents the correlation between residuals from subsequent
generations.

We manipulated the capacity and productivity parameters $b$ and $a$ as
part of the portfolio simulation. The capacity parameters $b_i$ were
controlled by the investment weights in the populations. For example, a
large investment in a stream was represented by a larger unfished
equilibrium stock size $b$ for stream $i$. The productivity parameters
$a_{ti}$ were controlled by the interaction between an environmental
signal and the stream-level population environmental-tolerance curves.

We generated the environmental-tolerance parabolas according to

\begin{equation}
  a_{ti} =
  \begin{cases}
    W_i (e_t - e_i^{\mathrm{opt}})^2 + a_i^{\mathrm{max}},
      & \text{if } a_{ti} > 0\\
      0, & \text{if } a_{ti} \leq 0
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $W_i$ controls the width of the curve for population
$i$, $e_t$ represents the environmental value at generation $t$,
$e_i^{\mathrm{opt}}$ represents the optimal environmental value for
population $i$, and $a_i^{\mathrm{max}}$ represents the maximum possible
$a$ value for population $i$. We set the $W_i$ parameters (Table
\ref{t:pars}) and calculated the $a_i^{\mathrm{max}}$ parameters so that
the area under each curve $A_i$ was equal. See Figure \ref{f:curves}a
for example environmental-tolerance curves.

\subsubsection{Straying}

We implemented straying as in \citet{cooper1999}. We set up the
metapopulation in a simple scenario: we arranged the populations in a
line and those that were nearer to each other were more likely to stray
between each other. Two parameters controlled the straying: the fraction
of fish $f_{\mathrm{stray}}$ that stray from their natal stream in any
generation and the rate $m$ at which this straying between streams
decays with distance. We calculated the number of salmon straying from
stream $j$ to stream $i$ as

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{strays}_{tij} = f_{\mathrm{stray}} R_{tj}
    \frac{e^{-m \lvert i-j \rvert }}
      {\displaystyle\sum\limits_{\substack{k = 1 \\
    k \neq j}}^{n} e^{-m \lvert k-j \rvert }}
  \label{eq:stray}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $R_{tj}$ is the number of returning salmon at generation
$t$ whose natal stream was stream $j$. The subscript $k$ represents a
stream ID and $n$ the number of populations. The denominator is a
normalizing constant to ensure the desired fraction of fish stray. See
Figure \ref{f:stray} for an example straying matrix.

\subsection{Fishing}

Our simulation used a simple set of rules to establish escapement
targets and harvest the fish. Every $f_\mathrm{assess}$ years (default
of five years) our simulation fitted a spawner-return function and
target harvest rate $H_{\mathrm{tar}}$ was set based on
\citet{hilborn1992} as

\begin{equation}
  H_{\mathrm{tar}} = \frac{A}{b (0.5 - 0.07a)}
  \label{eq:esc}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $A$ represents the return abundance and $a$ and $b$
represent the Ricker model parameters. We included implementation
uncertainty in the actual harvest rate $H_{\mathrm{act}}$ as

\begin{equation}
  H_{\mathrm{act}} = \mathrm{beta}(\alpha_h, \beta_h)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\alpha_h$ and $\beta_h$ are the location and shape
parameters in a beta distribution. They can be calculated from the
desired mean $\mu_h$ and standard deviation $\sigma_h$ as
\citep[p.~97]{morgan1990}

\begin{align}
  \alpha_h &= \mu_h^2
                \left(
                \frac{1 - \mu_h}{\sigma_h^2} - \frac{1}{\mu_h}
                \right)\\
   \beta_h &= \alpha \left({\frac{1}{\mu_h} - 1}\right).
\end{align}

\noindent Further, to establish a range of spawner-return values and to
mimic the start of an open-access fishery, for the first 30 years we
drew the fraction of fish harvested randomly from a uniform distribution
between 0.1 and 0.9. We discarded these initial 30 years as a burn-in
period throughout our analyses.

\subsection{Environmental dynamics}

We evaluated portfolio performance under short- and long-term
environmental dynamics. We represented short-term dynamics as a
stationary first-order autoregressive process, AR(1), with correlation
$\rho_e$

\begin{equation}
  e_t = e_{t-1} \rho_e + d_t, d_t \sim \mathrm{N}(0, \sigma_d)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $e_t$ represents the environmental value in generation
$t$ and $d$ represents normally distributed deviations of mean 0 and
standard deviation $\sigma_d$. We represented long-term environmental
dynamics as a linear shift in the environmental value through time

\begin{equation}
  e_t = \alpha_e + \beta_e t
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\alpha_e$ represents the intercept and $\beta_e$ the
slope. To maintain a balanced response, we centered the trend so that
midway through the simulation (after any burn-in period) the
environmental value was at the mean environmental tolerance.

\subsection{Conservation rules of thumb}

We evaluated two sets of conservation rules of thumb: (1) spatial
response diversity conservation strategies in an idealistic scenario
where you can detect response diversity, and (2) a more realistic
scenario where we know little about response diversity and we're left
with a choice of how many populations to conserve.

\subsubsection{Spatial conservation strategies}

We evaluated four spatial conservation rules of thumb (Figure
\ref{f:curves}b--e). In all spatial scenarios, we conserved four
populations and set the unfished equilibrium biomass of the remaining
populations to near elimination (five salmon). These reduced populations
could still receive straying salmon but were unlikely to rebuild on
their own to a substantial abundance. The four scenarios were:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Conserve an even sampling of response diversity.
\item
  Conserve the most stable populations only.
\item
  Conserve one half of the metapopulation.
\item
  Conserve the other half of the metapopulation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{How many populations to conserve?}

In reality we rarely know precise levels of response diversity. We
therefore additionally considered a case where the conservation was
randomly assigned with respect to response diversity but where different
numbers of streams could be conserved. We considered conserving from two
to 16 streams. Similarly to the spatial strategies, we reduced the
capacity of the remaining streams to the nominal level of five salmon.

We show metapopulations in which 2 (red), 4 (orange), 8 (yellow), or 16 (green) populations of random response diversity are conserved. The dots show simulated metapopulations and the contours show 25\% and 75\% quantiles across 500 simulations per strategy. We also show example metapopulation (c) rate-of-change and (d) abundance time series for the short-term environmental-fluctuation scenario.}
