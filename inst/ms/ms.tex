  Managing risk is fundamental to the conservation of an endangered species. When an endangered species exists as a metapopulation, we can manage risk at two levels: at the population level or at the metapopulation level. Whereas risk is typically managed at the population level, a portfolio approach to managing risk might consider how conservation affects the ``weight'' of each population in a metapopulation ``portfolio''.
\item
  Here, we ask how a portfolio approach to managing risk can inform the spatial conservation of metapopulations in a changing world. To answer this, we develop a salmon metapopulation simulation in which population-specific productivity is driven by spatially-distributed environmental tolerance and patterns of short- and long-term environmental change. We then implement different spatial conservation ``rules of thumb'' that control the population-specific carrying capacities and evaluate the salmon portfolios along risk and return axes, similarly to how financial portfolios are assessed.
\item
  Our results show, first, that maintaining populations with a variety of environmental tolerances gives the best chance at an efficient ecological portfolio --- minimizing metapopulation variance while maximizing metapopulation growth rate. This finding emphasizes the risk of allowing large spatial blocks of habitat destruction, say through the development of dams. Second, we show that focusing on well-performing stocks now at the detriment of others is at best equivalent to a risky but efficient portfolio and is more likely a risky and inefficient portfolio --- it neither minimizes metapopulation variance nor maximizes growth rate compared to other strategies. Third, we show that maintaining more populations reduces metapopulation risk for the same spatial conservation strategy. Given a lack of knowledge of how populations respond to the environment, the most risk-averse approach is to conserve as many populations as possible.
\item
  Our findings highlight three key points: (1) the conservation priority of maintaining biocomplexity and therefore environmental response diversity, (2) the research priority of identifying differences in environmental tolerance given predicted environmental changes, and (3) the utility of considering risk for groups of fish stocks --- especially given environmental, biological, and implementation uncertainty --- through the lens of portfolio theory.

Here, we ask how a portfolio approach to management can inform the conservation of metapopulations in a changing world. We ask two primary questions: (1) What does portfolio optimization tell us about different spatial approaches to prioritizing metapopulation conservation assuming that response diversity is spatially distributed? (2) If we don't know how response diversity is distribute, what does portfolio optimization tell us about how many populations we should conserve? To answer these questions, we develop a salmon metapopulation simulation in which population-specific productivity is driven by spatially-distributed environmental tolerance and patterns of short- and long-term climatic change. We then implement different conservation ``rules of thumb'' that control the population-level carrying capacities and evaluate the salmon portfolios along risk and return axes, as a portfolio manager would. Our findings illustrate that: (1) conserving response diversity buffers metapopulation risk given short-term climate forcing and rate of return given long-term climate forcing, (2) conserving more subpopulations buffers risk regardless of the climate trend, and (3) considering metapopulations through the lens of portfolio theory provides a useful additional dimension through which we can evaluate conservation strategies.

\section{Methods}

We developed a salmon metapopulation simulation model that includes a stock-recruit relationship, demographic stochasticity, straying between populations, varying responses to the environment, escapement target setting, and implementation uncertainty. Under two kinds of environmental regimes we tested different conservation rules of thumb and evaluated these plans in risk-return space similar to how financial managers evaluate financial portfolios. See Figure \ref{f:sim-flow} for an illustration of the overall simulation structure. See Table \ref{t:pars} for a list of the input parameters to our simulation and their default values. We provide a package \texttt{metafolio} for the statistical software \texttt{R} \citep{r2013} as an appendix, to carry out the simulations and analyses we describe in this paper.

\subsection{Defining the ecological portfolio}

In our ecological portfolios, we defined assets as stream-level populations and the portfolios as salmon metapopulations (Table \ref{t:port}). We use the terms \emph{stream} and \emph{populations} interchangeably to represent the portfolio assets. We defined the portfolio investors as the stakeholders in the fishery and metapopulation performance. For example, we could consider fisheries managers, conservation agencies, or First Nations groups as investors. We defined asset value as the abundance of returning salmon in each stream and value of the portfolio as the overall metapopulation abundance. In this scenario, the equivalent to financial rate of return is the generation-to-generation rate of change of metapopulation abundance. We defined the financial asset investment weights as the capacity of the stream populations --- specifically the unfinished equilibrium stock size --- since maintaining or restoring habitat requires money, time, and resources. Investment in a population therefore represents investing in salmon habitat conservation or reconstruction.

\subsection{Salmon metapopulation dynamics}

The salmon metapopulation dynamics in our simulation were governed by a spawner-return relationship with demographic stochasticity and by straying between populations.

\subsubsection{Spawner-return relationship}

We defined the spawner-return relationship with a Ricker model \citep{ricker1954},

\begin{equation}
R_{ti} = S_{ti}e^{a_{ti}(1-S_{ti}/b_i) + w_{ti}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $t$ represents a generation time, $i$ represents a population, $R$ is the number of returns, $S$ is the number of spawners, $a$ is the productivity parameter (which can vary with the environment), and $b$ is the density-dependent term (which is used as the asset weights in the portfolios). The term $w_{ti}$ represents first-order autocorrelated error. Formally, $w_{ti} = w_{ti-1} \rho_w + r_{ti}$, where $r_{ti}$ represents independent and normally distributed error with mean 0 and standard deviation of $\sigma_r$. The parameter $\rho_w$ represents the correlation between residuals from subsequent generations.

We manipulated the capacity and productivity parameters $b$ and $a$ as part of the portfolio simulation. The capacity parameters $b_i$ were controlled by the investment weights in the populations. For example, a large investment in a stream was represented by a larger unfished equilibrium stock size $b$ for stream $i$. The productivity parameters $a_{ti}$ were controlled by the interaction between an environmental signal and the stream-level population environmental-tolerance curves.

We generated the environmental-tolerance parabolas according to

\begin{equation}
  a_{ti} =
  \begin{cases}
    W_i (e_t - e_i^{\mathrm{opt}})^2 + a_i^{\mathrm{max}},
      & \text{if } a_{ti} > 0\\
      0, & \text{if } a_{ti} \leq 0
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $W_i$ controls the width of the curve for population $i$, $e_t$ represents the environmental value at generation $t$, $e_i^{\mathrm{opt}}$ represents the optimal environmental value for population $i$, and $a_i^{\mathrm{max}}$ represents the maximum possible $a$ value for population $i$. We set the $W_i$ parameters (Table \ref{t:pars}) and calculated the $a_i^{\mathrm{max}}$ parameters so that the area under each curve $A_i$ was equal. See Figure \ref{f:curves}a for example environmental-tolerance curves.

\subsubsection{Straying}

We implemented straying as in \citet{cooper1999}. We set up the metapopulation in a simple scenario: we arranged the populations in a line and those that were nearer to each other were more likely to stray between each other. Two parameters controlled the straying: the fraction of fish $f_{\mathrm{stray}}$ that stray from their natal stream in any generation and the rate $m$ at which this straying between streams decays with distance. We calculated the number of salmon straying from stream $j$ to stream $i$ as

\begin{equation}
  \mathrm{strays}_{tij} = f_{\mathrm{stray}} R_{tj}
    \frac{e^{-m \lvert i-j \rvert }}
      {\displaystyle\sum\limits_{\substack{k = 1 \\
    k \neq j}}^{n} e^{-m \lvert k-j \rvert }}
  \label{eq:stray}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $R_{tj}$ is the number of returning salmon at generation $t$ whose natal stream was stream $j$. The subscript $k$ represents a stream ID and $n$ the number of populations. The denominator is a normalizing constant to ensure the desired fraction of fish stray. See Figure \ref{f:stray} for an example straying matrix.

\subsection{Fishing}

Our simulation used a simple set of rules to establish escapement targets and harvest the fish. Every $f_\mathrm{assess}$ years (default of five years) our simulation fitted a spawner-return function and target harvest rate $H_{\mathrm{tar}}$ was set based on \citet{hilborn1992} as

\begin{equation}
  H_{\mathrm{tar}} = \frac{A}{b (0.5 - 0.07a)}
  \label{eq:esc}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $A$ represents the return abundance and $a$ and $b$ represent the Ricker model parameters. We included implementation uncertainty in the actual harvest rate $H_{\mathrm{act}}$ as

\begin{equation}
  H_{\mathrm{act}} = \mathrm{beta}(\alpha_h, \beta_h)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\alpha_h$ and $\beta_h$ are the location and shape parameters in a beta distribution. They can be calculated from the desired mean $\mu_h$ and standard deviation $\sigma_h$ as \citep[p.~97]{morgan1990}

\begin{align}
  \alpha_h &= \mu_h^2
                \left(
                \frac{1 - \mu_h}{\sigma_h^2} - \frac{1}{\mu_h}
                \right)\\
   \beta_h &= \alpha \left({\frac{1}{\mu_h} - 1}\right).
\end{align}

\noindent Further, to establish a range of spawner-return values and to mimic the start of an open-access fishery, for the first 30 years we drew the fraction of fish harvested randomly from a uniform distribution between 0.1 and 0.9. We discarded these initial 30 years as a burn-in period throughout our analyses.

\subsection{Environmental dynamics}

We evaluated portfolio performance under short- and long-term environmental dynamics. We represented short-term dynamics as a stationary first-order autoregressive process, AR(1), with correlation $\rho_e$

\begin{equation}
  e_t = e_{t-1} \rho_e + d_t, d_t \sim \mathrm{N}(0, \sigma_d)
\end{equation}

\noindent where $e_t$ represents the environmental value in generation $t$ and $d$ represents normally distributed deviations of mean 0 and standard deviation $\sigma_d$. We represented long-term environmental dynamics as a linear shift in the environmental value through time

\begin{equation}
  e_t = \beta_e t - \overline{\beta_e t}
\end{equation}

\noindent where $\beta_e$ represents the slope. To maintain a balanced response, we centered the trend by subtracting the mean $\overline{\beta_e t}$ so that midway through the simulation (after any burn-in period) the environmental value was at the mean environmental tolerance.

\subsection{Conservation rules of thumb}

We evaluated two sets of conservation rules of thumb: (1) spatial response diversity conservation strategies in an idealistic scenario where you can detect response diversity, and (2) a more realistic scenario where we know little about response diversity and we're left with a choice of how many populations to conserve.

We evaluated four spatial conservation rules of thumb (Figure \ref{f:curves}b--e). In all spatial scenarios, we conserved four populations and set the unfished equilibrium biomass of the remaining populations to near elimination (five salmon). These reduced populations could still receive straying salmon but were unlikely to rebuild on their own to a substantial abundance. The four scenarios were:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Conserve an even sampling of response diversity.
\item
  Conserve the most stable populations only.
\item
  Conserve one half of the metapopulation.
\item
  Conserve the other half of the metapopulation.
\end{enumerate}

In reality we rarely know precise levels of response diversity. We therefore additionally considered a case where the conservation was randomly assigned with respect to response diversity but where different numbers of streams could be conserved. We considered conserving from two to 16 streams. Similarly to the spatial strategies, we reduced the capacity of the remaining streams to the nominal level of five salmon.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Which populations to conserve?}

\subsubsection{Short-term environment}

Given strong short-term environmental fluctuations, conserving response diversity buffers the risk properties of an ecological portfolio (Fig.~\ref{f:sp-mv}a). In our simulation, the median variance of generation-to-generation rate of change in abundance was X times lower given balanced response diversity (full range of responses or most stable only vs.~conserving one half or the other). In fact, even though by conserving the full range of responses, the portfolio was comprised of warm and cool-thriving populations that were more variable on their own, each was balanced by an opposing population. The portfolio risk was therefore comparable between the full range of responses and most stable only portfolios.

We can see the mechanism behind these portfolio properties by inspecting example population time series (Fig.~\ref{f:sp-mv}c, d). If only the upper or lower half of response diversity is conserved, the portfolio tends to do well or poorly depending on the environmental conditions (Fig.~\ref{f:sp-mv}d). This risk is buffered with balanced response diversity (Fig.~\ref{f:sp-mv}c).

\subsubsection{Long-term environment}

Given long-term environmental change, the choice of which populations to conserve affects the return properties of an ecological portfolio (Fig.~\ref{f:sp-mv}b). By conserving balance response diversity, an ecological manager is hedging his or her bets on what will happen with the environment and how the populations will respond. The typical return for a balanced response diversity strategy was zero --- the metapopulation neither increased or decreased in abundance in the long run. By conserving only the upper or lower half of response diversity, a conservation manager is putting all his or her eggs in one basket --- the metapopulation might do really well through time or it might do really poorly. The example metapopulation abundance time series (Fig.~\ref{f:sp-mv}d, f) illustrate this effect. By conserving response diversity, when one population is doing poorly, another is doing well and the metapopulation abundance remains stationary through time.

Notably, in theses simulations, if a managers invested in the populations that were doing well at the beginning they would have had the lowest rate-of-return portfolio in the end (purple portfolios in Fig.~\ref{f:sp-mv}b).

Spatial conservation strategies in the face of longterm environmental change hinge on whether you ``get it right'' --- whether you choose just the right populations to conserve.

\subsection{How many populations to conserve?}

Given a scenario where we don't know the distribution of population-level response diversity, portfolio optimization informs us about the risk buffering from maintaining multiple populations (Fig.~\ref{f:n-mv}). In short, investing in more populations buffers portfolio risk.

\subsubsection{Short-term environment}

Given short-term environmental noise, conserving more populations buffers portfolio risk while the random conservation of response diversity creates a spread of metapopulation risk for the same number of populations conserved (Fig.~\ref{f:n-mv}a). For example, a metapopulation with eight conserved populations is X times less risky than a metapopulation with only four. We can see this risk-buffering effect through example metapopulations in Fig.~\ref{f:n-mv}c and \ref{f:n-mv}d. We note that the risk-return axes of portfolio optimization ignore the absolute-abundance dimension (Fig.~\ref{f:n-mv}d). As one would expect, conserving fewer populations also results in lower-abundance metapopulations.

\subsubsection{Long-term environment}

Given long-term environmental noise, conserving more populations also buffers portfolio risk. However, in contrast to the short-term environmental noise scenario, the unknown response diversity creates a spread of possible metapopulation return for the same number of conserved populations (Fig.~\ref{f:n-mv}b). Here, the number of populations conserved buffers non-systematic (i.e.~not-environmentally-driven) stochasticity.
