<!--Managing risk is fundamental to the conservation of an endangered species. -->


<!--When an endangered species exists as a metapopulation, we can manage risk at two levels: at the population level or at the metapopulation level. Typically we treat sources of risk at the metapopulation level as external and uncontrollable and so we manage risk by altering fishing or hunting on a population level as well as improving the connectivity of populations.-->

<!--The management of financial portfolios provides another way of considering risk for metapopulations. -->
<!--Economists consider the risk and performance of a financial portfolio as a function of the weighting of individual assets that make up the portfolio. Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) proposes that there is a set of portfolios that maximizes expected return for a level of expected risk or minimizes expected risk for a level of expected return [@markowitz1952; @markowitz1959]. This optimal set contains portfolios that range along a continuum of risk-tolerance; economists refer to this set as the efficient frontier.-->

- Managing risk is fundamental to the conservation of an endangered species.
	- risk is usually assessed on a population by population basis
	- for metapopulations, we can consider risk for components or risk for the whole
- The management of financial portfolios provides another way of considering risk for metapopulations.
	- performance of weighted assets
	- efficient frontier concept
	- the parallels with ecological metapopulations
- Pacific salmon are an ideal model to consider under the framework of portfolio prioritization because of their metapopulation structure, their societal importance and threatened status, and the need to prioritize conservation efforts.
	- portfolio-like structure
		- documented metapopulation structure
		- predators and fisheries often integrate across stocks
	- Highly threatened; highly valued; face many threats
		- damns
		- roads
		- other habitat degradation
		- logging
		- fishing
		- changing climate
	- There's a need for prioritization
		- because of the highly threatened nature
		- conflicting goals for resource use
		- limited resources
		- Existing prioritization schemes
- Portfolio stabilization through systematic asynchrony in salmon population dynamics can be driven by stocks responding uniquely to the same environment ('response diversity') or by physical features of the environment causing stocks to experience different environmental forces ('environmental filter').
	- different responses to the environment: response diversity / biocomplexity
		- genetic variation by stock
		- can be driven through historical conditions
		- we focus on this here
	- experiencing different environment: environmental filter concept (Moran like)
		- spatially spread out, geographical and hydrological features filter the environment to create a variety of forces
		- Typically a combination of both
	- Conversely, forces acting against asynchrony
		- inverse: loss of population diversity
		- inverse: moran
		 - but also: dispersal
		- and: trophic interactions with synchronized species

Here, we ask how a portfolio approach to management can inform the conservation of metapopulations in a changing world. 
We ask two primary questions: 
(1) What does portfolio optimization tell us about different spatial approaches to prioritizing metapopulation conservation assuming that response diversity is spatially distributed? 
(2) In a scenario where we don't know the population-level response diversity, what does portfolio optimization tell us about the number of populations conserved? 
To answer these questions, we develop a salmon metapopulation simulation in which population-specific productivity is driven by spatially-distributed environmental tolerance and patterns of short- and long-term climatic change. 
We then implement different conservation "rules of thumb" that control the population-level carrying capacities. 
We evaluate the salmon portfolios along risk and return axes, similarly to how financial portfolios are assessed. 
Our findings illustrate that:
(1) conserving response diversity buffers metapopulation risk given short-term climate forcing and rate of return given long-term climate forcing,
(2) conserving more subpopulations buffers risk regardless of the climate trend, and
(3) considering metapopulations through the lens of portfolio theory provides a useful additional dimension through which we can evaluate conservation strategies.

<!--(3) the research priority of identifying differences in environmental tolerance, and (3) the utility of considering risk for metapopulations --- especially given environmental, biological, and implementation uncertainty --- through the lens of portfolio theory.-->
