  abstract	= {One of the most pervasive themes in ecology is that
		  biological diver- sity stabilizes ecosystem processes and
		  the services they provide to society1--4, a concept that
		  has become a common argument for bio- diversity
		  conservation5. Species-rich communities are thought to
		  produce more temporally stable ecosystem services because
		  of the complementary or independent dynamics among species
		  that per- form similar ecosystem functions6. Such variance
		  dampening within communities is referred to as a portfolio
		  effect7 and is analogous to the effects of asset diversity
		  on the stability of financial portfolios8. In ecology,
		  these arguments have focused on the effects of species
		  diversity on ecosystem stability but have not considered
		  the impor- tance of biologically relevant diversity within
		  individual species9. Current rates of population
		  extirpation are probably at least three orders of magnitude
		  higher than species extinction rates10, so there is a
		  pressing need to clarify how population and life history
		  diversity affect the performance of individual species in
		  providing impor- tant ecosystem services. Here we use five
		  decades of data from Oncorhynchus nerka (sockeye salmon) in
		  Bristol Bay, Alaska, to provide the first quantification of
		  portfolio effects that derive from population and life
		  history diversity in an important and heavily exploited
		  species. Variability in annual Bristol Bay salmon returns
		  is 2.2 times lower than it would be if the system consisted
		  of a single homogenous population rather than the several
		  hundred discrete populations it currently consists of.
		  Furthermore, if it were a single homogeneous population,
		  such increased variability would lead to ten times more
		  frequent fisheries closures. Portfolio effects are also
		  evident in watershed food webs, where they stabilize and
		  extend predator access to salmon resources. Our results
		  demon- strate the critical importance of maintaining
		  population diversity for stabilizing ecosystem services and
		  securing the economies and livelihoods that depend on them.
		  The reliability of ecosystem services will erode faster
		  than indicated by species loss alone.},
