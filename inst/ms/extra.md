<!--1.  Managing risk is fundamental to the conservation of an endangered species. When an endangered species exists as a metapopulation, we can manage risk at two levels: at the population level or at the metapopulation level. Whereas risk is typically managed at the population level, a portfolio approach to managing risk might consider how conservation affects the "weight" of each population in a metapopulation "portfolio".-->

<!--2.  Here, we ask how a portfolio approach to managing risk can inform the spatial conservation of metapopulations in a changing world. To answer this, we develop a salmon metapopulation simulation in which population-specific productivity is driven by spatially-distributed environmental tolerance and patterns of short- and long-term environmental change. We then implement different spatial conservation "rules of thumb" that control the population-specific carrying capacities and evaluate the salmon portfolios along risk and return axes, similarly to how financial portfolios are assessed.-->

<!--3.  Our results show, first, that maintaining populations with a variety of environmental tolerances gives the best chance at an efficient ecological portfolio --- minimizing metapopulation variance while maximizing metapopulation growth rate. This finding emphasizes the risk of allowing large spatial blocks of habitat destruction, say through the development of dams. Second, we show that focusing on well-performing stocks now at the detriment of others is at best equivalent to a risky but efficient portfolio and is more likely a risky and inefficient portfolio --- it neither minimizes metapopulation variance nor maximizes growth rate compared to other strategies. Third, we show that maintaining more populations reduces metapopulation risk for the same spatial conservation strategy. Given a lack of knowledge of how populations respond to the environment, the most risk-averse approach is to conserve as many populations as possible.-->

<!--4.  Our findings highlight three key points: (1) the conservation priority of maintaining biocomplexity and therefore environmental response diversity, (2) the research priority of identifying differences in environmental tolerance given predicted environmental changes, and (3) the utility of considering risk for groups of fish stocks --- especially given environmental, biological, and implementation uncertainty --- through the lens of portfolio theory.-->

<!--### How optimal are the conservation strategies? ###-->
<!--We then considered how optimal these rules of thumb were across all possible conservation-prioritization strategies.-->

<!--To test how optimal the strategies were, we generated metapopulation portfolios in which the investment weights (Ricker $b$ parameters) were randomly assigned such that the total available "investment" remained constant. This Monte-Carlo strategy illustrates a large sample of possible portfolios in risk-return space. We then placed the conservation strategies listed above into this space to determine how close to the efficient frontier they lie. [Figure not shown yet]-->

<!--We considered the sensitivity of our results to a variety of parameter values. In Table \ref{t:pars} we describe the base-case values used in the main paper and the alternative values for results shown in the Supporting Material.-->
