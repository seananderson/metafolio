Abstract
========

Managing risk is fundamental to conserving endangered species. When an
endangered species exists as a metapopulation, we typically manage risk at the
population level. However, assessing risk to the overall metapopulation would
necessitate a more integrated perspective to consider how conservation affects
the "portfolio" of populations within the metapopulation. Here we ask how a
portfolio approach can inform conservation priorities for metapopulations
in a changing world. We develop a salmon metapopulation simulation where
population-specific productivity is driven by spatially-distributed thermal
tolerance and patterns of short- and long-term environmental change. We then
implement spatial conservation scenarios that control population carrying
capacities and evaluate the salmon portfolios as a portfolio manager might
--- along axes of risk and return. We show that conserving response diversity
minimizes risk given environmental stochasticity and ensures persistence given
long-term environmental change. Further, conserving more populations minimizes
risk regardless of response diversity distribution. These findings have
important implications for how we prioritize conservation actions <!--MMM: or
conservation of populations--> and emphasize the importance of conserving the
processes that promote response diversity.  <!--MMM: such as...?-->

Introduction
============

Untangling the mechanisms that underpin the stability of ecological systems
is a critical focus of ecology [@loreau2010a; @loreau2013; @demazancourt2013]
(REFS).  Decades of research has focused on the role of species richness and
functional diversity in driving community stability (REFS).  However, recent
research has highlighted that the drivers of ecological stability are much
more complex and multidimensional than previously thought [@balvanera2006]
(REFs).  Two key dimensions of stability that have been comparatively
understudied are response diversity [@mori2013] --- different responses to the
environment by functionally similar species [@chapin1997; @elmqvist2003] ---
and the role of metapopulations (REF).  Here, we look to unpack the role of
response diversity conservation in stabilizing metapopulations given projected
changes in climate.  With unprecedented loss of biodiversity and levels of
environmental change, it is more critical than ever to consider conservation
approaches that maintain system stability in the face of environmental
uncertainty [@ando2012].

Typically, conservation actions to maintain system stability and thereby
reduce risk are driven by an ad hoc combination of scientific information,
political influences, and feasibility (REFs); the management of financial
portfolios provides another way of considering risk [@figge2004;
@koellner2006; @ando2012]. Economists work to minimize risk and maximize
performance of a financial portfolio by building a portfolio of individual
investments (called assets) with different attributes.  For example, different
sectors can be expected to perform differently in different economic
conditions and when one rises in value another may fall.  Modern Portfolio
Theory proposes that out of all possible portfolios, there is a small
subset of portfolios that maximizes expected return for a level of risk or
minimizes risk for a level of return, and that only by considering risk and
return in tandem can an investor achieve maximum benefit from a portfolio
[@markowitz1952].

<!--While decades of research has focused on the role of species richness,
    recent research has highlighted the complexity and multidimensionality of
    the drivers of ecological stability [@balvanera2006] (REFS), and
    comparatively little attention has been paid to the role of response
    diversity [@mori2013] --- different responses to the environment by
    functionally similar species [@chapin1997; @elmqvist2003].-->

<!--One of these key dimensions is response diversity --- different responses
    to the environment by functionally similar species [@chapin1997;
    @elmqvist2003] --- and compared to species and functional diversity,
    comparatively little attention has been paid to this dimension
    [@mori2013].-->


<!--Response diversity can be isolated by studying metapopulations...-->

<!--Metapopulations can play an important role in identifying the role of response-->
<!--diversity because...-->

<!--and it is increasingly apparent that metapopulations play a-->
<!--unique and important role in maintaining ecosystem stability [@anderson2013]-->
<!--(REFS).-->


Similarly, expected growth rate and variance of a metapopulation is a
function of the variance, covariance, and size of the individual populations
[@moore2010]. An ecological portfolio approach to managing risk for a
metapopulation might therefore consider how conservation actions affect the
weight of each population in a metapopulation portfolio. This investment
weight could represent the conservation budget or the habitat conserved for
each population. We can consider the population growth rate as the rate of
return and the variability of that growth rate as a metric of risk. Ecological
managers can then consider how various investment strategies affect the
expected risk and return of their ecological portfolio.

Managing Pacific salmonids under the uncertainty of climate change is an ideal
scenario to consider through the lens of portfolio theory for three reasons.
(1) Pacific salmonids form metapopulations [@rieman2000; @schtickzelle2007]
and we can consider, for example, the metapopulation in a river-catchment
as a portfolio and the stream populations as assets [@schindler2010;
@moore2010].  Continuing the analogy, fisheries [@hilborn2003] and predators
[@schindler2013] often integrate across multiple populations, acting as
investors in the salmon portfolio. Fisheries managers and conservation
agencies then act as portfolio managers by choosing which salmon habitat
to prioritize for protection or restoration. Indeed, recovery goals for
Pacific salmonids are often set at the metapopulation level, and knowing what
minimizes risk to the metapopulation can help choose efficient conservation
actions (REFS). (2) Many Pacific salmonid metapopulations are highly
threatened [@mcclure2003; @gustafson2007; @peterman2012] and will likely
become more at risk as threats such as overfishing, dams, roads, logging, and
particularly climate change, intensify [e.g. @lackey2003]. (3) Salmonids are
highly valued by society, fishers, conservation groups, and indigenous people
[@nrc1996]. Although civil society allocates extensive resources to conserving
salmonids, the scale of the problem demands a prioritization of conservation
efforts [@allendorf1997; @ruckelshaus2002].

Two key mechanisms can generate the asynchrony in metapopulation dynamics that
is critical to a diversified portfolio. First, localized habitat features
can filter the environment generating unique conditions for populations
[@schindler2008] (*senu* the Moran effect). However, since salmonids spend
considerable time in a shared ocean environment [@quinn2005], a second
mechanism is also important --- diversity of response to the environment
[i.e. response diversity, @elmqvist2003; and biocomplexity, @colwell1998;
@hilborn2003]. This mechanism can result from unique phenotypic or genetic
traits [@crozier2008; @kovach2012] and be derived from rapid contemporary
adaption [@stockwell2003; @fraser2011] or long-term evolution to historical
conditions [@eliason2011]. In reality, these mechanisms can interact. For
example, salmonid response diversity in the marine environment can be driven
by adaptation to localized freshwater environments (REF).  <!--In this paper
we focus on the response-diversity mechanism, and evaluate it in the context
of thermal response diversity.-->

Salmonids are strongly affected by climate warming [e.g. @patterson2007]
and yet show a remarkable diversity of tolerance to temperature [e.g.
@crozier2006; @eliason2011]. In addition to posing perhaps the greatest threat
to global biodiversity in general [@thomas2004], climate warming poses a
particular threat to riverine species whose ranges are largely confined to
existing habitat [@thomas2010]. Warmer water can lead to massive mortality
of salmonid populations [e.g. @patterson2007; @macdonald2010] and indirectly
impact salmonid productivity through alterations to snow-melt timing and
extreme hydrological events [@crozier2008]. Due to these effects, adverse
stream temperatures are already impeding recovery of some Pacific salmonid
populations [@mccullough1999] and are expected to make recovery targets
more difficult to achieve [@battin2007]. However, despite the evidence that
warming impacts salmonids, salmonids also show evidence of response diversity
and local adaptation to temperature. For example, juvenile Chinook salmon
in southern regions of British Columbia, Canada, tolerate high temperatures
better than northern populations [@beacham1991], and thermal tolerance of
sockeye salmon in the Fraser River, British Columbia, varies within streams
according to historical environmental conditions [@eliason2011].

Here, we ask how a portfolio approach to management can inform the
conservation of metapopulations in a changing world. We ask how portfolio
theory can inform spatial approaches to prioritizing metapopulation
conservation. To answer these questions, we develop a salmon metapopulation
simulation in which spatially-distributed thermal tolerance and patterns of
short- and long-term climatic change drive population-specific productivity.
We then implement scenarios that prioritize alternative sets of populations
and evaluate the salmon portfolios along risk-return axes, as a financial
portfolio manager might. We show that conserving response diversity
buffers metapopulation risk given short-term climate forcing and ensures
metapopulation persistence given long-term climate warming. We then show that
conserving more populations buffers risk regardless of response diversity or
climate trend, and conclude that considering metapopulations through portfolio
theory provides a useful additional dimension through which we can consider
conservation strategies.

Methods
=======

We developed a 100-year salmon metapopulation simulation model that includes
both population dynamics and harvesting along with process, observation,
and implementation uncertainty. We tested different conservation scenarios
under two kinds of environmental regimes and evaluated these plans along risk
and return dimensions similar to how financial managers evaluate financial
portfolios (Fig. 1). We provide a package `metafolio` for the statistical
software `R` [@r2013] as an appendix, to carry out the simulations and
analyses described in this paper.

Defining the ecological portfolio
---------------------------------

In our ecological portfolios, we defined assets as stream-level populations
and portfolios as salmon metapopulations. We use the terms *stream* and
*populations* interchangeably to represent the portfolio assets. We defined
the portfolio investors as the stakeholders in the fishery and metapopulation
performance. For example, the investors could be conservation agencies,
First Nations groups, or civil society as a whole. The fisheries management
agency then becomes the portfolio manager. We defined the asset value as the
abundance of returning salmon in each stream and the value of the portfolio
as the overall metapopulation abundance. In this scenario, the equivalent to
financial rate of return is the generation-to-generation metapopulation growth
rate. We defined the financial asset investment weights as the capacity of the
stream populations --- specifically the unfinished equilibrium stock size ---
since maintaining or restoring habitat requires money, time, and resources.
Investment in a population therefore represents investing in salmon habitat
conservation or restoration and stable investment strategies are emergent
properties of our metapopulation model.

Salmon metapopulation dynamics
------------------------------

<!--MMM: Overall, in the description of the model, consider adding a bit
more detail – how many populations total were modeled?  I inferred that at
initiation, they are all the same size, and capacity varies when they are
either eliminated (not prioritized for saving), or conservation actions are
put in place.  But, I could be wrong!-->

<!--TODO SA: add number of pops for spatial, describe what's happening at
initiation...-->

The salmon metapopulation dynamics in our simulation were governed by a
spawner-return relationship with demographic stochasticity and straying
between populations.

We defined the spawner-return relationship with a Ricker model [@ricker1954],

$$R_{i(t)} = S_{i(t)}e^{a_{i(t)}(1-S_{i(t)}/b_i) + w_{i(t)}}$$

where $i$ represents a population, $t$ a generation time, $R$ the number of
returns, $S$ the number of spawners, $a$ the productivity parameter (which
can vary with the environment), and $b$ the density-dependent term (which is
used as the asset weights in the portfolios). The term $w_{i(t)}$ represents
first-order autocorrelated error. Formally, $w_{i(t)} = w_{i(t-1)} \rho_w +
r_{i(t)}$, where $r_{i(t)}$ represents independent and normally distributed
error with mean 0 and standard deviation of $\sigma_r$ (0.3; we include
the base values in parentheses after relevant parameters). The parameter
$\rho_w$ (0.4) represents the correlation between residuals from subsequent
generations.

We manipulated the capacity and productivity parameters $b_i$ and $a_{i(t)}$
as part of the portfolio simulation. The capacity parameters $b_i$ were
controlled by the investment weights in the populations. For example, a large
investment in a stream was represented by a larger unfished equilibrium
stock size $b$ for stream $i$. The productivity parameters $a_{i(t)}$ were
controlled by the interaction between a temperature time series and the
population thermal-tolerance performance curves.

We generated the thermal-tolerance curves according to

$$a_{i(t)} = \begin{cases} a_i^{\mathrm{max}} -
W_i (e_t - e_i^{\mathrm{opt}})^2,
& \text{if } a_{i(t)} > 0\\ 0, & \text{if } a_{i(t)} \leq
0 \end{cases}$$

where $W_i$ controls the width of the curve for population $i$,
$e_t$ represents the environmental value at generation $t$,
$e_i^{\mathrm{opt}}$ represents the optimal temperature for population $i$,
and $a_i^{\mathrm{max}}$ represents the maximum possible $a$ value for
population $i$. We set the $W_i$ parameters (evenly spaced values increasing
and decreasing between 0.05 and 0.02) and calculated the $a_i^{\mathrm{max}}$
parameters so that the area under each curve was equal (30 units). We chose
parameter values such that some populations were warm-tolerant, some were
cold-tolerant, and some had a wider range of thermal-tolerance, but a lower
maximum productivity (Fig. 2a). Although we refer to a thermal-tolerance
curve because temperature is a dominant driver of salmonid performance
[@mccullough1999], our model applies to any environmental tolerance [e.g.
tolerance to stream flow volume or changes in snow melt timing, @crozier2008].

We implemented straying as in @cooper1999. We arranged the populations in a
line and salmon were more likely to stray to streams near their natal stream
(Fig. \ref{f:stray}). Two parameters controlled the straying: the fraction
of fish $f_{\mathrm{stray}}$ (0.02) that stray from their natal stream in
any generation and the rate $m$ (0.3) at which this straying between streams
decays with distance. We calculated the number of salmon straying from stream
$j$ to stream $i$ as

$$\mathrm{strays}_{ij(t)} = f_{\mathrm{stray}} R_{j(t)} \frac{e^{-m \lvert i-j
\rvert }} {\displaystyle\sum\limits_{ \substack{k = 1 \\ k \neq j}}^{n} e^{-m
\lvert k-j \rvert }}$$

where $R_{j(t)}$ is the number of returning salmon at generation $t$ whose
natal stream was stream $j$. The subscript $k$ represents a stream ID and $n$
the number of populations. The denominator is a normalizing constant to ensure
the desired fraction of fish stray.

Our simulation did not account for the homogenization of diversity due to
straying. For example, all salmon in one population maintained the same
thermal-tolerance curve regardless of how many salmon it received from another
stream. However, the low straying rates in our simulation rate should render
this effect minimal except for populations at low abundance.

Fishing
-------

Our simulation used a simple set of rules to establish escapement targets and
harvest the fish. First, to establish a range of spawner-return values and to
mimic the start of an open-access fishery, for the first 30 years we drew the
fraction of fish harvested randomly from a uniform distribution between 0.1
and 0.9. We discarded these initial 30 years as a burn-in period. Then, every
five years our simulation fitted a spawner-return function and the target
harvest rate $H_{\mathrm{tar}}$ was set based on @hilborn1992 as

$$H_{\mathrm{tar}} = \frac{A}{b (0.5 - 0.07a)} \label{eq:esc}$$

where $A$ represents the return abundance and $a$ and $b$ represent the Ricker
model parameters. We included implementation uncertainty in the actual harvest
rate $H_{\mathrm{act}}$ as

$$H_{\mathrm{act}} = \mathrm{beta}(\alpha_h, \beta_h)$$

where $\alpha_h$ and $\beta_h$ are the location and shape parameters in a beta
distribution. They can be calculated from the desired mean $H_{\mathrm{tar}}$
and standard deviation $\sigma_h$ (0.05) as [@morgan1990, p. 97]

$$\begin{aligned} \alpha_h &= H_{\mathrm{tar}}^2 \left( \frac{1 -
H_{\mathrm{tar}}}{\sigma_h^2} - \frac{1}{H_{\mathrm{tar}}} \right)\\ \beta_h
&= \alpha \left({\frac{1}{H_{\mathrm{tar}}} - 1}\right).\end{aligned}$$

Environmental dynamics
----------------------

Environmental dynamics typically have both short- and long-term fluctuations,
such as annual variability as well as directional climatic warming. We
evaluated portfolio performance under these two components separately. We
represented short-term dynamics as a stationary first-order autoregressive
process, AR(1), with correlation $\rho_e$ (0.1)

<!--MMM: I think some mention of not modeling PDO might be worthwhile.  -->

$$e_{\mathrm{short}(t)} = e_{t-1} \rho_e + d_t, d_t \sim \mathrm{N}(0, \sigma_d^2)$$

where $e_{\mathrm{short}(t)}$ represents the environmental value in generation
$t$ and $d$ represents normally distributed deviations of mean 0 and standard
deviation $\sigma_d$ (2). We represented long-term environmental dynamics as a
linear shift in the environmental value through time

$$e_{\mathrm{long}(t)} = \beta_e t - \overline{\beta_e t}$$

where $\beta_e$ (0.114) represents the slope. We centered the trend by
subtracting the mean $\overline{\beta_e t}$ so that midway through the
simulation (after the burn-in period) the environmental value was at the mean
environmental tolerance.

Combining salmon population dynamics, fishing, and environmental dynamics, we
illustrate the components of an example simulation in Fig. 3 and the effect of
varying parameters from their base values on metapopulation abundance in Fig.
\ref{f:eg-sens}.

Conservation scenarios
----------------------

We evaluated four spatial conservation scenarios (Fig. 2b--e). In all spatial
scenarios, we conserved four populations and set the unfished equilibrium
abundance of the six remaining populations to near elimination (five salmon)
at the start of the simulation. These reduced populations could still receive
straying salmon but were unlikely to rebuild on their own to a substantial
abundance. The four scenarios we considered were:

1.  Conserve a full range of response diversity (conserve some cool-, some
    intermediate-, and some warm-tolerant populations).

2.  Conserve the middle section of the metapopulation (conserve the most
    temperature-tolerant populations with the widest response curves).

3.  Conserve the lower half of the metapopulation (conserve cool-tolerant
    populations).

4.  Conserve the upper half of the metapopulation (conserve warm-tolerant
    populations).

In reality we rarely know precise levels of response diversity. We therefore
also considered a case where the conservation was randomly assigned with
respect to response diversity but where different numbers of streams could be
conserved. We considered conserving from two to 16 streams. As in the spatial
strategies, we reduced the capacity of the remaining streams to the nominal
level of five salmon.

Results
=======

Which populations to conserve?
------------------------------

*Given short-term environmental fluctuations* (strong interannual variation),
conserving response diversity reduces overall risk to an ecological portfolio
(Fig. 4a; Figs. \ref{f:eg-sp-arma-full}, \ref{f:eg-sp-arma-half}). In
our model, the average variance of metapopulation growth rate was 2.8
times lower given balanced response diversity (full range of responses
or most temperature-tolerant populations vs. conserving one half or the
other).  Response diversity also led to more consistent stability ---
there was less spread in variance across simulated metapopulations. These
increases in stability occurred despite the portfolios being comprised of
warm and cool-thriving populations that were more variable on their own than
populations with wide thermal-tolerance curves. We can see the mechanism
behind these portfolio properties by inspecting example population time
series (Fig. 4c, d). If only the upper or lower half of response diversity is
conserved, the portfolio tends to alternate between performing well and poorly
depending on the environmental conditions resulting in a risker portfolio
(Fig. 4e). This risk is buffered with balanced response diversity (Fig. 4c)
and the resulting asynchrony in population abundance (Fig. \ref{f:ret-corr}).

*Given long-term environmental change*, such as climate warming, the choice
of which populations to conserve affects the "return" (metapopulation
growth rate) properties of an ecological portfolio (Fig. 4b; Figs.
\ref{f:eg-sp-linear-full}, \ref{f:eg-sp-linear-half}). By conserving balanced
response diversity, an ecological manager is hedging his or her bets on
the environmental trend and how the populations will respond. The typical
metapopulation growth rate for a balanced response diversity strategy was
zero --- the metapopulation neither increased nor decreased in abundance in
the long run. The example metapopulation abundance time series (Fig. 4d,
f) illustrate the mechanism: by conserving response diversity, when one
population is doing poorly, another is doing well and the metapopulation
abundance remains stationary through time. If a manager had invested only in
the populations that were doing well at the beginning they would have had the
lowest rate-of-return portfolio in the end (purple portfolios in Fig. 4f).

How many populations to conserve?
---------------------------------

In a scenario where we don't know the distribution of population-level
response diversity, portfolio optimization informs us that investing in more
populations buffers portfolio risk regardless of environmental trend (Fig. 5).

*Given short-term environmental fluctuations*, conserving more populations
buffers portfolio risk, and at the same time, the random conservation of
response diversity creates a spread of metapopulation risk for the same number
of populations conserved (Fig. 5a; Figs. \ref{f:eg-n-arma-two},
\ref{f:eg-n-arma-sixteen}). For example, a metapopulation with 16 conserved
populations is 2.5 times less variable on average than a metapopulation with
only four (Fig. 5c). We note that the risk-return axes of portfolio
optimization ignore the absolute-abundance dimension (Fig. 5d). As one
would expect, conserving fewer populations also results in lower-abundance
metapopulations.

*Given long-term environmental change*, conserving more populations
also buffers portfolio risk (Fig. 5b; Figs. \ref{f:eg-n-linear-two},
\ref{f:eg-n-linear-sixteen}). However, in contrast to the short-term
environmental noise scenario, the unknown response diversity creates a
spread of possible metapopulation return for the same number of conserved
populations. Here, the number of populations conserved buffers non-systematic
(primarily demographic) stochasticity. The metapopulation growth rate of
the 16 population scenario was on average X times less variable than the
four population scenario and X times less variable than the two population
scenario.

Discussion
==========

<!--*JWM: Feels a bit heavy on salmon. Could you build out more to spatial
    planning for climate change? Cite that PNAS paper on portfolio planning.
    Etc.*-->

<!--MMM: GitHub issues: I think somewhere in the discussion of response
    diversity we want to have a full paragraph on ecological conditions and/or
    management actions that increase diversity of response to environmental
    conditions.-->

Our model demonstrates how population diversity can stabilize realistic
metapopulations under climate change. We show how maintaining populations
with a variety of thermal-tolerances reduces risk caused by short-term
environmental stochasticity and optimizes chances for long-term persistence
given climate change. Further, without knowing how response diversity
is distributed, conserving more populations reduces metapopulation risk
regardless of environmental trend and response-diversity distribution.
Combined, these findings illustrate that focusing on well-performing
stocks now at the detriment of others is at best equivalent to a risky but
efficient portfolio, and at worst a poorly-performing risky portfolio. In
this discussion, we begin by linking our model with real-world conservation
issues for Pacific Northwest salmonids. We then consider broader implications
for metapopulation conservation of any species and ecological stability in
general.

Implications for salmonid conservation
--------------------------------------

Our results emphasize the importance of promoting ecological conditions that
increase response diversity if stability is to be maintained in the face of
environmental uncertainty.  For example, since habitat heterogeneity can lead
to local adaptation [@taylor1991; @fraser2011], our results emphasize the
need to maintain a diversity of salmonid habitat [@rogers2008]. Our results
can also inform habitat prioritization decisions. If conservation actions
must be prioritized, then our model suggests we should focus on populations
that aren't spatially contiguous to maximize diversity of response to the
environment.  Finally, our results demonstrate the advantages of avoiding
structures that artificially remove response diversity. For salmonids, dams
are a prominent example [@waples2007; @pess2012]. Dams can have a double
impact whereby their introduction selectively eliminates a large swath of
contiguous habitat, perhaps analogous to our upper- or lower-half scenarios in
Fig. 4, and then mitigation approaches such as hatcheries can further reduce
population and response diversity if not carefully managed [@waples1991a;
@mobrand2005].  In fact, salmonid habitat lost to dams in the U.S. has been
biased towards warmer, drier, higher habitats (McClure et al. 2008 REF TODO)
and our findings suggest this may make current populations more risky in the
face of environmental change.

<!--*JWM: I agree that these structures do, in theory, match predictions. Yet
    the wild salmon policy hasn't been implemented effectively yet in most
    places and the US is now playing with a short deck as many
    rivers/populations have been heavily impacted in the past. So, there is a
    bit of a disconnect between theory and practice.*-->

The goals of existing salmonid management structures in the US and western
Canada support a portfolio conservation perspective. In the US, Evolutionarily
Significant Units (ESUs) represent salmon populations that are reproductively
isolated with an evolutionary heritage [@waples1991; @moritz1994] and
finer-scale Viable Salmonid Populations (VSPs) are defined as groups of fish
that are demographically independent of other such populations in a 100-year
time frame [@mcelhany2000]. In Canada, the rough equivalent to the ESU is a
Conservation Unit (CU) as defined by the Wild Salmon Policy [@dfo2005wsp]. A
CU consists of a group of salmon that are reproductively isolated and that if
lost would be unlikely to recolonize in a reasonable time frame [@dfo2005wsp].
Both the US and Canadian guidelines recognize still-finer-scale population
structure. We suggest that a salmon portfolio in our model could represent
an ESU or CU and that the lessons learned from our models are thus directly
applicable to management guidelines in the Pacific Northwest. Conversely, a
number of VSP guidelines, already agree with our findings. For example, VSP
guidelines suggest maintaining diversity in a variety of forms, focusing
conservation efforts not just where salmon are currently abundant, and
maintaining metapopulations with some populations near each other and others
further apart [@mcelhany2000].

Despite existing VSP and CU guidelines, in practice salmonid management often
deviates substantially...

hasn't been implemented effectively in most places

heavily impacted from past (REFs)

For example, there are still widespread hatcheries that release millions of
fish, homogenizing populations (and possibly reducing response diversity)
across North America (Pearse et al.\ 20XX TODO, McClure et al.\ 2008b
Evo.\ Apps.\ TODO).

Our model complements other simulation-based salmon-habitat prioritization
models.  While these other models tend to focus on detailed assessment of
individual fish stocks, our model is the first to consider the role of
response diversity in buffering risk for metapopulations as a whole. The
Shiraz model [@scheuerell2006] is one complementary prioritization scheme. It
focuses on detailed conditioning of the habitat-population-dynamics
relationship at multiple life-history stages for a single salmon
population. Whereas the Shiraz model can be applied to an entire watershed,
it combines the populations together as a single unit thereby ignoring the
role of response diversity.  A second salmon prioritization model proposes
combining population viability measures with an assessment of the genetic
consequences of losing particular populations [@allendorf1997]. This model,
however, also focuses on the assessment of individual stocks without
considering their covariance and therefore the performance of the salmon
portfolio as a whole. Our model does not replace these prioritization
schemes. Rather, it proposes an additional focus on prioritization that
optimizes metapopulation risk and growth across plausible environmental
scenarios while being robust to numerous sources of uncertainty.

Broad implications, research extensions, and priorities
-------------------------------------------------------

Our results emphasize the importance of thinking at the portfolio level when
making conservation decisions --- considering aggregate risk and performance
for ecological portfolios. Although our results may appear intuitive,
conservation decisions rarely consider aggregate risk and return --- critical
elements of optimally diversified ecological systems [@ando2012]. Thus we
can think of portfolio risk-return performance as another dimension of
conservation. This dimension emphasizes the value of a broader scale of
management and focusing not just on currently productive populations but
also on less productive populations to reduce long-term aggregate risk [e.g.
@hilborn2003; @price2008]. This perspective does not negate focussing at a
finer scale on the ecological "assets" themselves. Rather, as in finance,
it requires both an understanding of individual asset performance and an
assessment of the covariance between assets to predict properties of the
portfolio as a whole.

TODO add spatial planning in this paragraph above.

<!--MMM: Build on this in a little bit more positive or certain way.  I would
    bet that you could predict some of the results.   Consider adding those.
    Particularly for the PDO piece.   I also think you could build on this.
    This kind of work can generally inform protected area design (maximize
    habitat diversity) and so forth.  -->

We suggest a number of specific extensions to our simulation model. First our
model could be extended beyond thermal response diversity. While, other forms
of response diversity affecting productivity would have a similar effect,
the distribution of response diversity across a metapopulation does not
necessarily follow a linear gradient, different forms of response diversity
could interact, and environmental conditions could affect populations through
other mechanisms than productivity. Second, in addition to other taxa, our
model could be extended to ecological communities after accounting for species
interactions, or to meta-communities. Third, without any modifications, our
model could be used to consider the Moran or environmental-filter concept
[@schindler2008; @rogers2008] where populations experience increasingly
different environmental forces at further distances. Fourth, a model could
consider the contribution of contemporary evolution [@stockwell2003;
@reed2011]. These rapid adaptations to changes in the environment could
strongly affect portfolio performance and emphasize the importance of
maintaining genetic diversity. Finally, our model could be conditioned
on a system of interest --- a particular river basin for example --- and
the metapopulation portfolio could be optimized across conservation and
restoration options as part of a formal decision analysis.

Our results suggest three broad research priorities. First, our work
highlights the importance of research that identifies response diversity
[e.g. @eliason2011], spatial asynchrony [e.g. @thorson2013], and in
particular the management schemes that promote these processes [@moore2010;
@schindler2010]. Our work highlights how these processes can contribute to
reducing risk and increasing the likelihood of metapopulation persistence
given environmental uncertainty. Second, our work suggests the importance of
identifying the drivers of productivity across populations and environmental
scenarios. For example, what is the relative effect on productivity of
population density, an environment-recruitment relationship, and environmental
regime shifts, and what management approaches are robust to our uncertainty
about these contributions [@vert-pre2013]? Third, our work suggests research
that identifies real-life case studies as large-scale experiments testing
our conclusions and identifying how portfolio optimization best integrates
with societal goals. For example, portfolio optimization focuses on rate of
change, but in ecological systems, society might care more about absolute
abundance --- low-growth-high-abundance systems might be preferred to
high-growth-low-abundance systems.

Our analysis illustrates a pathway through which diversity of response
to environmental conditions can underpin the stability of ecological
systems. This pathway suggests increasing the focus on response diversity
in the discussion of ecological stability and resilience in addition to the
historically strong focus on species and functional diversity [@mori2013].
As ecology explores the role of response diversity, metapopulations make an
ideal first study system since they can mostly isolate response diversity (or
spatially diverse environmental conditions) from the complexity of species
interactions and diversity of functional roles. <!--A richer understanding of the
mechanisms underpinning stability and resilience in the face of environmental
change will requiring integrating response diversity with other stabilizing
mechanisms in more fully-featured ecosystems [@demazancourt2013; @loreau2013].
--> 
The mean-variance portfolio approach used here offers promise in
reconciling the interaction between mechanisms that influence functionality or
"return" and instability or "risk". Given current and pending dramatic changes
to climate and the uncertainty involved in predicting the impacts on habitat
availability, local temperature, and local precipitation (REF), strategies
such as the portfolio approach outlined here, are a useful way to integrate
across this uncertainty.

<!--In conclusion, our results demonstrate the utility of considering
metapopulations in a portfolio context and the power of portfolio simulation
to consider management strategies that minimize metapopulation risk and
maximize growth under uncertain environmental conditions. Our findings
show that response diversity buffers metapopulation risk given short-term
environmental stochasticity and ensures persistence given longterm regime
changes. Further, our findings show that, independent of response-diversity,
conserving more populations buffers metapopulation risk. These results
point to the critical importance of choosing management, conservation, and
restoration actions that preserve and promote response diversity and are
robust to our uncertainty about the distribution of response diversity and
future climatic conditions.-->

Fig. 2: Different ways of prioritizing response-diversity conservation. Panel
a shows thermal tolerance cures for ten possible populations and panels
b--e show different ways of prioritizing four of those populations. The
curves describe how productivity varies with temperature for a given
population. Some populations thrive at low temperatures (cool colours) and
some at warm temperatures (warm colours). Some are tolerant to a wider range
of environmental conditions (yellow-to-green colours) but with a lower maximum
productivity. The total possible productivity (the area under the curves) is
the same for each population.

Fig. 4: The importance of preserving environmental response diversity through
spatial conservation strategies. The conservation strategies correspond
to Fig. 2 and represent conserving a range of responses (green), the most
stable populations only (orange), or one type of environmental response
(purple and pink). In risk-return space we show environmental scenarios that
are comprised primarily of (a) short-term and (b) long-term environmental
fluctuations. The dots show simulated metapopulations and the contours show
25% and 75% quantiles across 500 simulations per strategy. We also show
example metapopulation abundance time series for the (c, e) short-term and (d,
f) long-term environmental-fluctuation scenarios. The grey line indicates the
efficient frontier across all simulated metapopulations.  <!--MMM: I found the
last sentence a bit confusing.  Better explain what a frontier is and point
out which panels it's in.-->
