- Existing strategies for prioritizing stream restoration fall into 6 
  general categories: @Beechie2008
1. project type (what's most likely to succeed quickly?)
2. protect intact habitat as refugia first
3. scoring system
4. single-species analytic models
5. multi-species analytic models
6. models with cost effectiveness

- In reality, capacity (b) is a function of both quality and quantity of 
  habitat

- the specific adaptations of salmon to climate change are uncertain, but 
  maintaining diversity (life history and genetic) will likely increase 
  resilience @Battin2007

- habitat restoration important part of "offsetting effects of climate change" 
  for salmon @Battin2007

- "Viable salmon populations (VSP) are defined by four important metrics: 
  abundance, productivity, spatial structure, and diversity (McElhany et al. 
  2000)."

- Shiraz model is similar, the primary difference is that we simply one 
  aspect, modelling life-stages separately, to focus on the important aspects 
  for our research questions. We aren't focused on the role of affecting the 
  vital rates at various life-stages but on the environment-response 
  relationship and habitat capacity. Also, our model uses a Ricker instead 
  of a Beverton-Holt @Scheuerell2013

- our model therefore focuses on the 3 key components of salmon performance 
  productivity, capacity, and life-history diversity @Mobrand1997

- "the extinction of a salmon population can represent an irreversible loss of 
  genetic diversity" and therefore, identifying local adaptation is of great 
  importance @Mobrand1997

- *key reference* life-history diversity dampens extinction risk with 
  environmental fluctuations @denBoer1968

- *key reference* @Taylor1991: local adaptation of salmonids is evident on 
  broad scales (100s of kms apart) and locally (between pops that are a < a 
  few km apart); likely quite important for persistence and should be 
  maintained; important to study

- General rule for straying from @Schtickzelle2007: straying should be 
  sufficient to avoid extinction or bring back subpops from low abundance, but 
  unlikely to affect general population dynamics or synchronize pops

- metapopulation concept has important implications for salmon but is usually 
  ignored (word only mentioned in 0.25% of papers!) @Schtickzelle2007

- importance of metapopulations for salmon been known for decades - see 
  (Ricker's 1972) review:  @Schtickzelle2007

- ``For an ESU, the importance of dispersal typically arises, however, at 
  longer-time scales (evolutionary time) allowing gene flow across the entire 
  unit.''  @Schtickzelle2007 

- ``The term ‘metapopulation’ was coined more than three decades ago by 
  Levins, who defined it as a population of populations which go extinct 
  locally and recolonize (Levins 1969, 1970), ''

- From the relatively narrow Levins concept, i.e. independent and identical 
  populations, our present view of metapopulations has broadened (Harrison 
  1991, 1994; Hanski and Gilpin 1997; Harrison and Taylor 1997): ‘any 
  assemblage of discrete local populations with migration among them is 
  considered to be a metapopulation, regardless of the rate of population 
  turnover’ (Hanski and Gilpin 1997 p. 2). ``  @Schtickzelle2007 

- ``Peterman et al. (1998) found correlation coefficients below 0.75 for 
  survival rates of sockeye salmon at the regional or larger scale '' 
  @Schtickzelle2007 

- ``This is confirmed by other studies, both at the regional scale: 
  approximately )0.50 to 1.00 for distances up to 175 km in the Kvichak River 
  system (Stewart et al. 2003a)''  @Schtickzelle2007 

- ``Dispersal among populations seems to be too limited (see below) to play a 
  role in synchronizing populations, except in situations when abundance 
  decreases to low levels (Isaak et al. 2003) or perhaps for certain types of 
  habitats, e.g. beaches (Stewart et al. 2003b).''  @Schtickzelle2007 

- ``Nevertheless, heterogeneity in habitat features and life history traits, 
  collectively termed ‘biocomplexity’ (Hilborn et al. 2003), may induce a 
  different response of the populations to the same cause (Kindvall 1996).''  
  @Schtickzelle2007 

- ``p.305: This interaction with biocomplexity is probably also responsible 
  for the fact that environmental conditions explain a relatively small 
    proportion of the variability in salmon survival rates (Mueter et al. 
    2005) -- Highlighted 2013-03-02''  @Schtickzelle2007 

- ``Generally, both shared environmental conditions and dispersal are assumed 
  a priori to be more likely to happen for populations close to each other; 
  for many species correlation effectively decreases with the distance between 
    populations (Liebhold et al. 2004).''  @Schtickzelle2007 

- ``p.305: Individuals from different populations of the same region, even 
  very distant populations, meet in the same area during the time they spend 
  at sea or are subject to processes that are well correlated over large 
  spatial scales (Quinn 2005 and references therein). There, they encounter 
  similar conditions affecting their survival, e.g. coastal conditions 
  experienced by juvenile salmons and influenced by the Pacific Decadal 
  Oscillation (Mantua et al. 1997; Mueter et al. 2005).  -- Highlighted

- ``Indeed, populations close to each other experience similar freshwater 
  conditions, but all populations in a certain region experience similar, 
  although certainly not identical, marine conditions. '' @Schtickzelle2007

  to this is through sensitivity analyses across a range of possible values

  recession in southeast Alaska (Quinn 1993; Milner et al. 2000) or after some 
  natural or artificial barrier is removed (Bryant et al. 1999; Anderson and 
  Quinn 2007). Even if a small fraction of strays seems at first glance 
  incompatible with such a high power of (re)colonization, it is not.''

- ``p.305: populations farther away, experiencing different freshwater and 
  marine conditions, are less correlated or even negatively correlated if

- ``p.305: On the contrary, in anadromous species all fish start their return

- @Mueter2002 use residuals from B-H S-R relationship as an index of survival,

- SST important in Ricker S-R models of pacific salmon pops - @Peterman2009

  better than single stock fits

- @Peterman2009 - 15 pops, 100 years, p.141: The five models that we explored

  Ricker model but with an autocorrelated lag-1 (AR(1)) error term (equations 
  (1) and (4)), (3) a Ricker model that assumed that the ai parameter in equation 
  (1) could vary with time (ai,t) and that was fit using a Kalman filter 
  (Peterman et al. 2000), (4) the multi-stock mixed-effects model 
  (equation (6)) used by Mueter et al. (2002a), and (5) the version of the

- @Peterman2009 ``In the most realistic environmental scenarios, which assumed 
  an AR(1) climate process and step functions in mean productivity like that 
  seen in the mid-1970s in the North Pacific Ocean,''

- From @Collie2012 SOM: ``Sea-surface temperature is not likely a direct 
  physiological limiting factor on survival rate, but rather is more likely an 
  indirect surrogate for oceanographic conditions that reflect predator 
  abundance and/or food supply for chum salmon.  Recent warmer conditions in 
  the Bering Sea have led to earlier ice retreat and a later bloom with a 
  large copepod biomass (Macklin and Hunt 2004). Thus, warmer conditions may 
  enhance feeding, growth, and survival of chum salmon stocks in the AYK 
  region. These correlations are consistent with the hypothesis that chum 
  salmon productivity is primarily determined by ocean survival, as opposed to 
  freshwater survival (Kruse 1998).''

- @Collie2012 ``There is considerable empirical evidence that productivity of 
  salmon populations is influenced by variation in environmental (especially 
  oceanographic) conditions at both high-frequency, interannual scales (Mueter 
  et al. 2002) and at low-frequency, decadal scales (Beamish 1995; Mantua et 
  al. 1997; Francis et al. 1998). Therefore, to generate spawner-to-recruit 
  dynamics in our simulations, we used a standard Ricker model that was 
  modified to have a time-varying a parameter to reflect that decadal-scale 
  environmental variability in addition to the usual high-frequency 
  variability:''
