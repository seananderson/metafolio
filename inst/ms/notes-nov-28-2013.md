<!--When an endangered species exists as a metapopulation, we typically-->
<!--manage risk at the population level, but a more integrated perspective-->
<!--might consider how conservation affects the "portfolio" of populations-->
<!--with within a metapopulation. -->

<!--TODO look at: @angilletta2008 Big dams and salmon evolution: changes in
    thermal regimes and their potential evolutionary consequences-->
<!--TODO: work with this from Crimson Tide paper?-->
<!--While scientific and policy attention has focused on conserving species
diversity, it is becoming increasingly appar- ent that distinct populations are
under substantially more threat from human activities than are species [15]. For
example, salmon watersheds of the Pacific Northwest have lost approxi- mately 29
per cent of the population diversity of Pacific salmon [16], whereas no single
species is at imminent risk of extinction. We suggest that future work should
focus on understanding how biological diversity within individual taxa affects
species’ interactions, and ecosystem processes and services, to better inform
conservation and management policy.-->

<!--This pathway-->
<!--suggests greater consideration of response diversity in discussions of-->
<!--ecological stability, in addition to focusing on species and functional-->
<!--diversity [@mori2013].-->

<!--Traits and--> <!--behaviours that can respond with
variation include population responses such as--> <!--productivity, fitness,
or mortality, as well as individual responses such as--> <!--foraging and
migration [@elmqvist2003]. -->
<!--TODO - merge this and the next paragraph into one pithy paragraph-->
<!--TODO and bring in that although intuitive, and frequent tenant, hasn't
    been quantitative shown before-->
<!--TODO Bring in that the climate variability will probably increase:
(Seager et al. 2012), global to regional climate effects uncertain (Solomon
et al. 2007, Deser et al. 2012), and effects on ecological systems strong but
variable and uncertain @walther2002 or @parmesan2006 therefore need for these
kinds of approaches increasing in importance-->

<!--TODO add: this kind of work can generally inform protected area design-->

<!--Although our results may appear intuitive, conservation decisions rarely
consider aggregate risk and return --- critical elements of optimally
diversified ecological systems [@ando2012]. Thus we can think of portfolio
risk-return performance as another dimension of conservation. -->

<!--This dimension incorporates the value of a broader scale of management
and focusing not just on currently productive populations but also on less
productive populations to reduce long-term aggregate risk [e.g. @hilborn2003;
@price2008]. This perspective does not negate focussing at a finer scale
on the ecological "assets" themselves. Rather, as in finance, it requires
both an understanding of individual asset performance and an assessment of
the covariance between assets to predict properties of the portfolio as a
whole.-->

<!--TODO rework this based on Michelle and Jon suggestions:-->

<!--@mote2003: 0.5-2.5 C increase by 2020 in PNW and 1.5-3.2 by 2040

<!--TODO check where I can move cites to end-->

<!--TODO cite \citep{naiman2002} ? Pacific salmon, nutrients, and the dynamics of freshwater and riparian ecosystems-->

<!--Our analysis details a pathway by which diversity of response to environmental-->
<!--conditions can underpin the stability of ecological systems.-->
<!--This pathway suggests greater consideration of response diversity in
    discussions of ecological stability, in addition to focusing on species and
    functional diversity [@mori2013].-->

<!--Furthermore, while such discussions have historically focused on
    communities, metapopulations make ideal study systems for isolating the
    influence of response diversity on ecological stability from that of species
    interactions and functional diversity [@akcakaya2007; @anderson2013].-->

<!--By simultaneously evaluating mean and variance dimensions, the portfolio
    approach used here may help unite the long-standing discussions about
    mechanisms that influence functioning [e.g. @loreau2001] and instability
    [e.g. @ives2007] of ecological systems.-->

<!--Thus, the ecological portfolio concept holds considerable promise both as an
    applied management tool and a theoretical research paradigm.-->

<!--Michelle suggestions: I think I would focus this last paragraph more on the
    management implications.  You could take the phrase that I’ve highlighted
    above, and use that to draw some common sense conclusions about varying
    habitats, artificial selection that reduces diversity (e.g. in the salmon
    world, partially passable barriers can reduce the range of viable run
    timings; harvest reduces fish size, and so forth…), possibly even mention
    translocation as an option (this one isn’t my favorite, but it’s one we have
    to accept or reject looking at all the risks and benefits.)  So, maybe
    reduce this paragraph, and add a final third one on that topic   -->
<!--Sean: This approach sounds good if we go with an applied/conservation
    journal-->

<!--In conclusion, our results demonstrate the utility of considering
    metapopulations in a portfolio context and the power of portfolio
    simulation to consider management strategies that minimize metapopulation
    risk and maximize growth under uncertain environmental conditions. Our
    findings show that response diversity buffers metapopulation risk given
    short-term environmental stochasticity and ensures persistence given
    longterm regime changes. Further, our findings show that, independent of
    response-diversity, conserving more populations buffers metapopulation
    risk. These results point to the critical importance of choosing
    management, conservation, and restoration actions that preserve and
    promote response diversity and are robust to our uncertainty about the
    distribution of response diversity and future climatic conditions.-->
