- Spatial conservation
	- Short-term environment
		- Response diversity conservation affects risk properties of portfolio
		- Nearly the same portfolio whether you invest in the most stable or the full range of responses
		- Local demographic extinction may be different
		- You can see this for an example metapopulation time series: c, e: generation-to-generation fluctuations dampened by response diversity - a ying for every yang
	- Long-term environment
		- Response diversity conservation affects return properties of portfolio
		- Depends whether you "get it right" in choosing the right populations to conserve
		- Notably, those that are most productive at first are no longer so later
		- You can see what's happening in the example time series: d, f: You get it right or wrong in the long run. Response diversity means that when one does poorly another is doing well, longterm rate of return is stable
- Number
	- Short-term environment
		- More is usually better for risk (give ratios)
		- The unknown response diversity causes a risk spread
		- Example time series: Fig 4c: Can see the stabilizing effect of number on the rate of change
		- Example time series Fig 4d:  The way we've set it up, this also affects the absolute abundance - a double whammy
	- Long-term environment
		- The unknown response diversity causes a spread in rate of return - some cases do well, some do poorly depending on the selection of traits
		- More is also usually better in terms of risk
		- More dampens demographic stochasticity
		- More likely to end up with response diversity?
