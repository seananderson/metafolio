## Which populations to conserve? ##

### Short-term environment ###

Given strong short-term environmental fluctuations, conserving response diversity buffers the risk properties of an ecological portfolio (Fig. 4a). In our simulation, the median variance of generation-to-generation rate of change in abundance was X times lower given balanced response diversity (full range of responses or most stable only vs. conserving one half or the other). In fact, even though by conserving the full range of responses, the portfolio was comprised of warm and cool-thriving populations that were more variable on their own, each was balanced by an opposing population. The portfolio risk was therefore comparable between the full range of responses and most stable only portfolios.

We can see the mechanism behind these portfolio properties by inspecting example population time series (Fig. 4c, d). If only the upper or lower half of response diversity is conserved, the portfolio tends to do well or poorly depending on the environmental conditions (Fig. 4d). This risk is buffered with balanced response diversity (Fig. 4c). 

### Long-term environment ###

Given long-term environmental change, the choice of which populations to conserve affects the return properties of an ecological portfolio (Fig. 4b). By conserving balance response diversity, an ecological manager is hedging his or her bets on what will happen with the environment and how the populations will respond. The typical return for a balanced response diversity strategy was zero --- the metapopulation neither increased or decreased in abundance in the long run. By conserving only the upper or lower half of response diversity, a conservation manager is putting all his or her eggs in one basket --- the metapopulation might do really well through time or it might do really poorly. The example metapopulation abundance time series (Fig. 4d, f) illustrate this effect. By conserving response diversity, when one population is doing poorly, another is doing well and the metapopulation abundance remains stationary through time.

Notably, in theses simulations, if a managers invested in the populations that were doing well at the beginning they would have had the lowest rate-of-return portfolio in the end (purple portfolios in Fig. 4b).

Spatial conservation strategies in the face of longterm environmental change hinge on whether you "get it right" --- whether you choose just the right populations to conserve.

## How many populations to conserve? ##

Given a scenario where we don't know the distribution of population-level response diversity, portfolio optimization informs us about the risk buffering from maintaining multiple populations (Fig. 5). In short, investing in more populations buffers portfolio risk.

### Short-term environment ###

Given short-term environmental noise, conserving more populations buffers portfolio risk while the random conservation of response diversity creates a spread of metapopulation risk for the same number of populations conserved (Fig. 5a). For example, a metapopulation with eight conserved populations is X times less risky than a metapopulation with only four. We can see this risk-buffering effect through example metapopulations in Fig. 5c and 5d. We note that the risk-return axes of portfolio optimization ignore the absolute-abundance dimension (Fig. 5d). As one would expect, conserving fewer populations also results in lower-abundance metapopulations.

### Long-term environment ###

Given long-term environmental noise, conserving more populations also buffers portfolio risk. However, in contrast to the short-term environmental noise scenario, the unknown response diversity creates a spread of possible metapopulation return for the same number of conserved populations (Fig. 5b). Here, the number of populations conserved buffers non-systematic (i.e. not-environmentally-driven) stochasticity.
