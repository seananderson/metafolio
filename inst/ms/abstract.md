# Long and rambling abstract that's a bit old now #
1. Managing risk is fundamental to the conservation of an endangered species. 
   When an endangered species exists as a metapopulation, we can manage risk at 
   two levels: at the population level or at the metapopulation level. Whereas 
   risk is typically managed at the population level, a portfolio approach to 
   managing risk might consider how conservation affects the "weight" of each 
   population in a metapopulation "portfolio".

2. Here, we ask how a portfolio approach to managing risk can inform the 
   spatial conservation of metapopulations in a changing world. To answer this, 
   we develop a salmon metapopulation simulation in which population-specific 
   productivity is driven by spatially-distributed environmental tolerance and 
   patterns of short- and long-term environmental change. We then implement 
   different spatial conservation "rules of thumb" that control the 
   population-specific carrying capacities and evaluate the salmon portfolios 
   along risk and return axes, similarly to how financial portfolios are 
   assessed.

3. Our results show, first, that maintaining populations with a variety of 
   environmental tolerances gives the best chance at an efficient ecological 
   portfolio --- minimizing metapopulation variance while maximizing 
   metapopulation growth rate. This finding emphasizes the risk of allowing 
   large spatial blocks of habitat destruction, say through the development of 
   dams. Second, we show that focusing on well-performing stocks now at the 
   detriment of others is at best equivalent to a risky but efficient portfolio 
   and is more likely a risky and inefficient portfolio --- it neither 
   minimizes metapopulation variance nor maximizes growth rate compared to 
   other strategies. Third, we show that maintaining more populations reduces 
   metapopulation risk for the same spatial conservation strategy. Given a lack 
   of knowledge of how populations respond to the environment, the most 
   risk-averse approach is to conserve as many populations as possible. 

4. Our findings highlight three key points: (1) the conservation priority of 
   maintaining biocomplexity and therefore environmental response diversity, (2) the
   research priority of identifying differences in environmental 
   tolerance given predicted environmental changes, and (3) the utility of 
   considering risk for groups of fish stocks --- especially given 
   environmental, biological, and implementation uncertainty --- through the 
   lens of portfolio theory.
