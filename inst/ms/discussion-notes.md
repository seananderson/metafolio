<!--given increasing pressure of climate change on salmonid populations [e.g. @mccullough1999; @hodgson2002; @isaak2010]. -->


<!--Endangered species require robust strategies to manage risk.-->
<!--e.g. problem of fragmentation - @schnell2013
but rates of "climatic niche evolution" severely slower than required by climate change: @quintero2013-->

<!--River species can't just move poleward like other species  @thomas2010 (but not a great ref)-->

<!--from Thorson et al. 2013: "Conversely, spatially structured population models-->

<!--5 all variability and extinction risk at the metapopulation-->
<!--6 scale (Heino et al. 1997; Earn 2000; Engen, Lande &-->
<!--7 Sæther 2002)."-->

<!--from Thorson et al. 2013: "11 Spatial and temporal variability in demographic rates-->
<!--12 such as survival and fecundity has been much discussed in-->
<!--13 the ecological literature (Clark 2003) and has also-->
<!--14 been demonstrated using high-quality data in several-->
<!--15 high-profile cases (e.g. Coulson et al. 2001; Barrowman-->
<!--16 et al. 2003; Clark, LaDeau & Ibanez 2004)."-->

<!--From Thorson et al. 2013: "Theory suggests that local density dependence may weaken the synchrony among populations driven by either dispersal or correlated environmental forcing (i.e. the ‘Moran effect’), particularly if the strength of den- sity dependence varies spatially (Liebhold, Koenig & Bjørnstad 2004)."-->

<!--from @thorson2013: "Studies in fishes and birds have reported levels of synchrony ranging from weak to strong in stage-specific survival (Grenouillet et al. 2001; Ringsby et al. 2002; Crozier & Zabel 2006; Tavecchia-->
<!--21 et al. 2008), fecundity (Tavecchia et al. 2008), sex ratio-->

<!--23 general theory linking synchrony in vital rates to syn--->
<!--24 chrony in abundance at a population or metapopulation-->
<!--25 level."-->


<!--From @thorson2013: "Density dependence has previously been documented for salmonids in migration, growth and survival (Bjornn 1971, 1978; Sekulich 1980; Walters, Copeland & Venditti 2013), and its strength has been shown to vary among populations (Barrowman et al. 2003), although our study is the first to our knowledge to quantify the degree of variability in density dependence among both years and populations. "-->

<!--from @thorson2013: "Some theoretical models of spatially structured population dynamics (reviewed by Liebhold, Koenig & Bjørnstad 2004) suggest that heterogeneity among populations in the strength of density-dependent regulation can weaken temporal synchrony. The interplay between spatial and temporal variation in density dependence, environmental stochasticity and synchrony (or conversely, portfolio effects) would be a fruitful avenue for future research."-->

from abstract:
<!--This finding emphasizes the risk of allowing large spatial blocks of habitat destruction, say through the development of dams. -->
<!--Second, we show that focusing on well-performing stocks now at the detriment of others is at best equivalent to a risky but efficient portfolio and is more likely a risky and inefficient portfolio --- it neither minimizes metapopulation variance nor maximizes growth rate compared to other strategies. -->
<!--Third, we show that maintaining more populations reduces metapopulation risk for the same spatial conservation strategy. -->
<!--Given a lack of knowledge of how populations respond to the environment, the most risk-averse approach is to conserve as many populations as possible. -->
<!--Our findings highlight three key points: (1) the conservation priority of maintaining biocomplexity and therefore environmental response diversity, (2) the research priority of identifying differences in environmental tolerance given predicted environmental changes, and (3) the utility of considering risk for groups of fish stocks --- especially given environmental, biological, and implementation uncertainty --- through the lens of portfolio theory.-->

<!--See Table \ref{t:pars} for a list of the input parameters to our simulation and their default values. -->

<!--Examples of portfolio prioritization in face of climate change: @crowe2008, @ando2012, @ando2011-->

<!--Caveats TODO (perhaps work these into the methods or put back in discussion)
-	we know the precise response diversity and knew when it was balanced
-	short term climate and SR relationships notoriously difficult to estimate in reality
- On a longer time-scale, populations may evolve to changing climate, but within the 100 year time-scale of our model
-	obviously: this is a simulation, ideally work this into the methods-->

<!--Finally, these results emphasize that we can exploit these portfolio risk-buffering properties now without collecting more data or detecting the a stabilizing mechanism, such as response diversity, for a given system. This requires maintaining features that contribute to response diversity such as heterogeneous habitat, and maintaining as many populations as possible not just conserving those that are doing well now-->

<!--TODO for discussion-->
<!--By conserving only the upper or lower half of response diversity, a conservation manager is putting all his or her eggs in one basket --- the metapopulation might do really well through time or it might do really poorly. -->
<!--Spatial conservation strategies in the face of longterm environmental change hinge on whether you "get it right" --- whether you choose just the right populations to conserve.-->

## Linking our model to real-world salmon conservation ##

<!--Brain dump:-->
<!--- assuming no movement (as probably true for salmon) b/c those at lower range (for other situations) may be able to move... those on edges of habitat can't-->

*Link simulation and results to real issues for PNW salmon*

- salmon management conservation is highly fragmentary - dispersed among hatchery managers, who for example are trucking and releasing smolts all over the downstream catchment into San Fransisco bay - no planning about whether that's a sensible strategy given climate
- Examples of response diversity, specifics that match up with modelling framework
  - maybe Doug's paper - genetic diversity is best predictor of response diversity
- Range contraction
  - temp. tolerance - spatial contraction of pops - one would predict increased variance and risk - losing response diversity 
- Non-random extinction
  - really bad or really good, but not random
  - e.g. salmon in upper watershed tend to be impacted more by dams
- Climate change and response diversity
  - those that seem productive and/or stable now may not be in the future
  - by eliminating large spacial areas (e.g. damns) you're creating a higher risk ecological portfolio, if you get lucky you'll be OK, you might do much worse
  - @cheung2013 and Mantua papers
  - Stock-recruit Fredu paper cod and Benjamin Plonque CJFAS
  - @rogers2013 long-term fluctuations
  - @thorson2013 - show that spatial variation buffers fluctuations of juvenile salmon for Chinook in Snake River 


Our salmon model is relevant to PNW salmonid guidelines and mandates in the US and Canada. 
In the United States, NOAA consider salmon in Viable Salmonid Populations and Evolutionary Significant Units, which could be considered as portfolios and assets in our model. 
Viable Salmonid Populations refer to XX, and Evolutionary Significant Units to XX.

Our recommendations policy guidelines for VSPs. 
In particular, VSP guidelines suggest... Likewise our results suggest...

In Canada, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans  Wild Salmon Policy designates management units, and evaluates different levels of management intervention.

focuses on maintaining Conservation Units
"protect the genetic and geographic diversity of salmon species"
"policy recognizes the importance of habitat protection and rehabilitation"
The Wild Salmon Policy recognizes the importance of genetic and geographic diversity as well as the protection and rehabilitation of habitat (REF)
WSP will provide [from WSP itself] "Healthy,diverse,and abundant wild salmon populations for future generations" while providing fisheries and accounting for ecosystem and habitat values

or WSP end goal:
"Restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity"


Criteria 

*Link to existing guidelines and mandates in Canada and the US*


*What new do we learn for salmon management and conservation?*

- All recommendations for maintaining response diversity from @moore2010 (summarize those briefly?)
- If closer populations are more correlated with each other, and you must prioritize, then focus on a selection that aren't spatially contiguous (as long as straying is maintained) to maximize diversity of response to the environment
- Precautionary management: we assume precautionary abundance should we also be precautionary about response diversity?
- In many ways our results are intuitive, but we don't think about aggregate risk much, but there are many benefits to considering aggregate risk
- another dimension of conservation - or persistence
- not just leave all dams in place... reinvigorate selection for response diversity;  double whammy of damns - hatcheries added, further removing response diversity
    - Scale of management; integrated management planning

## Prioritizing metapopulation conservation ##

*Highlight how our work complements other simulation-based paths to prioritization*

- shiraz - single population - [@scheuerell2006]
- @halupka2003 - salmon prioritization scheme based on adaptive variation...
- @allendorf1997 - ranking scheme based on PVA and extinction consequences
- @haight2008 - scheme based on dispersal probabilities
- @pess2012 - based on Andy's paper
- I have others...


*There are a number of specific extensions to our simulation that could be useful.*

- We're only looking at one dimension of response diversity - thermal tolerance. All sorts of other kinds - climate, flow, predators and prey, behaviour...
- Metapopulations of other taxa, but also: community ecology, metacommunities
- Extend to environmental filter concept, possibly in addition to response diversity
- On longer timespan - evolution element
- We sought general rules of thumb; could also be used to optimize decisions as part of decision analysis --- working with simulations tailored to real systems to test competing management hypotheses

*Our work suggests three broad research priorities.*

1. Identifying what drives productivity in different scenarios --- e.g. density, environmental relationship, regimes? [Bring in @vert-pre2013] and therefore identifying management approaches that are robust to our uncertainty
2. Identifying response diversity and spatial asynchrony [e.g. thermal tolerance curves in @eliason2011]
3. Looking for real-life case studies as in situ experiments testing our conclusions; does managing salmon portfolios result in better outcomes?

## Conclusions ##

- reiterate rules of thumb
- reiterate utility of general portfolio simulation and optimization approach
