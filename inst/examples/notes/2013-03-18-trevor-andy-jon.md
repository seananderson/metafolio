- different risk-return tradeoffs - some thermal tolerance curves thin and narrow, some shallow and wide

- operationalize management/conservation plans

- reflective boundary? or circle, or loss of system
- implement circle straying

- summary stat for different plans - like cod-crab kind of

- once straying keeps them alive, the genetic pop is extinct - might want to turn off for this

- set management target based on a, b, parameters for sliding window or decaying weight

- talk about evolution to new environment over time

- show general trend with some sampled lines on top

- call increase climate warming... have set scenarios with names

- black swans would be heavy tailed arma... t-dist with few DF or cauchy

- optimal straying rate?

- try increasing monte carlo number and see if it gets smooth

- look at Quinn straying paper

- eco modelling, cons biology, cons letters... could be more general too... maybe the title could even use animals instead of salmon

- clearly set it up at beginning... what is my portfolio definition

- clearly state how b could be affected

- trevor says stay away from just temperature... mostly just Fraser that is affected that way

- do everything for base case and then report changes if you vary each parameter

- what is the region of m-v space occupied by various management plans?

- comparisons: even weights, all one (plot these), just least variable, those that do well at beginning, 1 from each category - high, medium, low (responses), VSP guidelines - how many pops..., upper ones lost (dam put in)

- Jon: pop disassembly rule?

- Jon: need more variability

- want variability to be primarily driven by the controlled response, env. tolerance

- could put in real time series - say temperature or PDO
